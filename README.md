# card_game_info

To learn more about data and webpage parsing, I am parsing the card game website Pagat.  

5 January 2016
I have successfully pulled the links from the games, and parsed the page for the names and information. 
Two issues right now - one, non-english game names - two, text that is hyperlinked did not pull.
