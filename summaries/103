The chips paid for a card are not bets in the ordinary sense: they do not have to be matched or called by the other players. They are fixed prices, paid by a player to the pot, over and above the normal betting process.\nBuy Your Card / Substitution\nIn this variant players can pay to exchange cards for better ones. The maximum number of players is six.\nThe players ante and the dealer deals five cards to each player: two face down and three face up. Players look at their face-down cards. The dealer deals a row of three more cards face up and places the undealt deck face down at the end of the row. The face-up card furthest from the deck costs 1 unit, the middle face-up card 2 units, the card next to the deck 3 units and the unknown top card of the deck 4 units, where 1 unit is equal to the ante and the minimum bet.\nThis is a high-low game with declaration. There are three rounds of buying, each followed by a round of betting.\nA buying round begins with the first active player to the left of the dealer and goes once around the table clockwise. At your turn you have three options:\n\nBuy a card. You discard one card from your hand and buy one of the four cards on offer to replace it, paying the appropriate amount to the pot. If you buy the top card of the face down deck, you look at it but keep it face down, even if you are replacing a face-up card. If you buy a face-up card you keep it face up if it replaces a face-up card from your hand, but turn it face down if it replaces one of your hole cards (even though the other players in fact know what it is). Players should always have at least two cards face-down and may have more.\nStand pat. You buy no card and keep your hand as it is.\nFold. You throw away your cards face down and take no more part in the hand. There is not really any point in doing this, since you could equally well fold in the following betting round.\n\nWhen a face-up card is bought, the dealer replaces it with a new face-up card which will be offered at the same price. If the last player in a buying round buys a face-up card, it is not replaced until after the ensuing betting round.\nThe betting round that follows each buying round is begun by the player who at that time has the best hand showing.\nAfter the third and last betting round the surviving players declare high, low or both before the showdown.\nSubstitution\nIn this variant, playable by up to 10 players, cards are not offered for sale but simply dealt to the players. As in Buy Your Card / Substitution each player is dealt two hole cards and three up cards, and there are three rounds of substitution, each followed by a betting round.\nIn a substitution round, each player in turn either stands pat or discards a card and is dealt a replacement card. If a hole card is discarded the replacement is dealt face down; if a face-up card is discarded, it is replaced by a new card dealt face up. Each betting round is begun by the player with the highest hand showing.\nSurviving players declare high, low or both before the showdown.\nAbyssinia\nIn this five card stud high-low variant players start with no cards and buy known or unknown cards to form their hand.\nThe players place their ante and the dealer turns up two cards and places them one each side of the face down deck. Starting with the player to dealer\'s left, each player in turn may choose to buy either one of the face up cards or the unknown top card of the face down deck. The price depends on the ran of the card - for example 2-5: 2 units, 6-K: 1 unit, ace: 4 units. If a card is bought from the deck it is dealt face up so that its price can be paid. After a face up card is bought, the top card of the deck is turned face up to replace it.\n After everyone has bought their first card there is a round of betting, begun by the player to dealer\'s left. The process is repeated four more times, so that each player who has not folded has five cards. The highest and lowest hands split the pot. \nThis game could be played with all players\' hands face up throughout, since in theory everyone knows what cards everyone has. Alternatively the players can pick up the cards as they buy them and hold them as a concealed hand. In this case the  fifth round of buying cards could be followed by a final betting round and declaration of high, low or both, though if the players have perfect memories they will already know who has won.    \nThe Price is Right\nThis is a seven-card stud high-low game for three to seven players in which everyone starts with two down-cards and buys the remainder.\nAfter players have placed their ante, the dealer deals two cards face down to each player: players may look at their cards. The dealer places  two cards face up on the table side by side with the face-down deck next to them. The upcard further from the deck costs 1 unit, the upcard nearer the deck costs 2 units and the unknown top card of the deck costs three units.\nEach player in turn, beginning with the player to the dealer\'s left, must either fold or  purchase \tone of the three cards on offer. Face-up cards remain face up; if the top card of the deck is bought, the buyer looks at it and keeps it face down, unknown to the other players. If the cheaper face-up card is bought, the dearer card slides over to replace it and a new card is turned up for the 2-unit position. If the dearer face-up card is bought it is replaced by turning up the top card of the deck. After everyone has had the chance to buy, there is a round of betting begun by the player with the best hand showing. \nThis is repeated until the final round of betting when everyone has seven cards. The players then declare high low or both and there is a showdown.\nVariation: this game can be played with three upcards costing 1, 2 and 3 units and the face down card costing 4.\nAuction\nThis is another seven-card high-low game. After antes are placed the dealer deals two cards face down to each player, which they may look at.\nThe dealer now deals face up to the table as many cards as there are players. Everyone simultaneously chooses how much to bid and holds that value of chips in a closed fist. Everyone must bid at least the amount of the minimum bet, and a maximum bid may also be agreed. On a signal from the delaer all players open their hands and reveal their bids. The player who bid highest chooses one of the face up cards and adds it to his or her hand face up; then the next highest bidder does the same and so on, the lowest bidder getting the last card. In case of a tie, the player with the higher poker hand showing goes first; if the hands are also equal, the player nearer to dealer\'s left has priority. All the bids are added to the pot. \nThis procedure is repeated four more times. When everyone has seven cards, there is a betting round. The surviving players then declare high, low or both and there is a showdown.\nGrocery Store Dots\nThis is a seven-card stud game. "Dots" are the pips in the centre column of each card: aces, fives, sevens and nines have one dot; twos, eights and tens have 2 dots, threes have three dots and fours, sixes and picture cards have no dots. The pot is split between the highest five-card hand and the player whose seven cards have most dots.\nAfter everyone has placed their ante, the dealer deals two hole cards and one upcard to each player as in seven-card stud, and the first betting round takes place. \nThe dealer then sets out the "grocery store" consisting of a row of three face up cards on the table, and marks the leftmost card by placing a chip or other marker on it. This card costs 1 unit, the card next to it 2 units and the third card 3 units. From now on, a player who is about to be dealt a card from the deck has the option to buy a card from the grocery store instead, placing the appropriate price in chips in the pot. A player who chooses not to buy is dealt a card from the deck as normal. \nIf a card is bought, the store is restocked from the deck immediately before the next purchase decision. That means that if the dealer buys a card, the store is not restocked until after the betting round that follows.\nWhen everyone has four upcards the remaining store stock is discarded, After the betting round, a final card is dealt to each player face down, and there is a final betting round foolowed by a showdown in which the high hand and the player with most dots split the pot.\nWall Street\nThis seven card stud game is similar to The Price is Right, with the difference that there are four face up cards on sale, and a player who does not wish to buy any of them is dealt a free card face up from the deck.\nThe dealer deals two cards face down and one face up  to each player, and a row of  four cards \tface up to the table. These cards are called Wall Street, and the card at one end of the row is marked with a chip. There is a round of betting, begun by the player with the highest card showing.\nNow each player in turn starting to dealer\'s left acquires another upcard. The card can be bought from Wall Street: the card marked with a chip costs 1 unit and the others cost 2, 3 and 4 units respectively. The price is paid to the pot. A player does not want to buy from Wall Street is dealt a card face up from the deck. Immediately before each purchase decision, any empty position in Wall Street is filled by dealing a new card from the deck. After everyone has their new card there is a betting round, begun by the player with the highest hand showing. Note that if the last player bought from Wall Street, there will only be three cards showing during the betting round, since Wall Street is not replenished until the beginning of the next buying round.\nThe process is repeated two more times, so that everyone has four up cards. The unsold Wall Street stock is then discarded. After the ensuing betting round a card is dealt face down to each player. There is a then final betting round after which players declare high, low or both and the high and low winners split the pot.  \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Buy Your Card\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2011.

Most poker variants can be reversed in this way, but the name "Lowball" is most often used to refer to a low version of Five Card Draw Poker. On this page several versions of this game are described. They differ in the  hand ranking, the drawing procedure and whether a wild card is used, and these are described on this page.\nThe different possible rankings for low poker are explained on the hand ranking page. The differences depend on whether Aces are counted as high or low, and whether straights and flushes count. Paired cards always count, so in the absence of straights and flushes a hand of five different ranks always beats a hand containing any duplicate ranks.\nWhen drawing to a five-card hand to make a low hand, it is seldom worth drawing more than one card. If you draw two cards you will make a pair about half the time, and however low the three cards are that you keep, your chance of getting a 9-high or better is never more than 25%. For this reason,  there are versions of lowball  in which players have more than one opportunity to draw. In such a game you can afford to draw more than one card the first time, but if you stay for the last draw you will either stand pat or draw just one card, hoping for a low card that does not pair with any of your other four.\nAlthough Draw Poker is perhaps the most usual form of Lowball game, the  Lowball version of Five Card Stud also works well, and Seven Card Stud Low is also played under the name Razz. The name Lowball is also occasionally used to refer to the game called Jacks Back on this site, which begins as Five Card Draw Jacks or Better and is played for low if no one has a good enough hand to open.\nCalifornia Lowball\nAlso known as Ace-to-Five Single Draw, this game is similar to Five Card Draw Poker, but in the showdown the lowest hand wins, using ace-to-five ranking. That is, aces are always low and straights and flushes do not count, so the lowest hand is A-2-3-4-5, then A-2-3-4-6, A-2-3-5-6, etc. AS always the highest cards of an unpaired hand are compared first, so for example 7-5-4-3-2 beats 7-6-3-2-A.\nIt is possible to play with an ante, but in formal games it is more often played with blinds. The dealer places a small blind and the next two players to the left of the dealer each place a big blind equal to the minimum bet. \nEveryone is dealt five cards and there is a round of betting. If an ante is used this begins with the player to the left of the dealer. When blinds are placed, these count as bets and the first betting round begins with the player immediately to the left of the blinds; the players who placed big blinds are allowed to raise when the turn comes around to them even if no one else has done more than call.\nAfter the first betting round, surviving players in turn, starting to the dealer\'s left, can discard any number of cards (in practice seldom more than one card) and are dealt replacements. There is then a second round of betting. If the game is played with blinds this is started by the first active player to dealer\'s left. If there are antes and no blinds, the second round is begun by the player who opened the first round of betting.\nWhen Lowball is played as a fixed limit game, some play that the size of the bet is doubled after the draw and others play that it remains the same.\nThis game is often played with a joker added to the deck. The joker, sometimes known as the fitter, represents the lowest rank not present in the holder\'s hand. For example 8-6-4-A-joker is equivalent to 8-6-4-2-A.\nBetting Sevens\nSome play that a player who checks after the draw with a hand that is 7-low or better (five different ranks with nothing higher than a 7) and has the best hand at the showdown can only win the chips that were in the pot at the time of the draw. Any chips that were bet after the draw are placed in a separate pot that this player is not eligible to win.\nBetting, calling a bet or raising after the draw entitles you to win the whole pot with your 7-low or better  if you have the best hand at the showdown, provided that you did not check at your first turn to act after the draw. It is therefore unwise to check after the draw with such a hand, unless you intend to fold if another player bets against you.\nKansas City Lowball\nKansas City Lowball is also called Deuce to Seven Single Draw or sometimes Billy Baxter Lowball after the player who won the world championship \nin this game several times.  In this game, Aces are always high and \nstraights and flushes do count (and are therefore bad), but A-2-3-4-5 \nis not a straight, because the Ace is high.  The best hand possible is 7-5-4-3-2 (hence "Deuce\nto Seven"), followed by 7-6-4-3-2, ... K-Q-J-10-8, A-5-4-3-2, A-6-4-3-2, \n... up to the usual royal flush, which is worst.  In other words, it\'s the exact \nopposite of normal high poker except for the A-2-3-4-5 rule.\nThe deal, draw and betting are similar to California Lowball. So far as I know, this game is normally played without a joker, and there is no equivalent of the "betting sevens" rule.\nThe Deuce to Seven page of the Play Lowball Poker site has further information on this game.    \nAce-to-Six Lowball\nThis is Five Card Draw Poker using ace-to-six ranking, in which straights and flushes count but aces can be low. Normally A-A should be the lowest (and therefore best) pair, but A-K-Q-J-10 would count as a straight - but opinions may differ, so these details should be agreed in advance among the players. \nThis game is often ignored or said to be unusual in books and on poker web sites. This may be because it is not played in public card rooms on the American West Coast and rarely offered as an online game. However, I suspect it is fairly widespread in home poker games, particularly on the American East Coast and in Europe.\nTriple Draw\nIn this game players have three opportunities to improve their hand. According to some sources the maximum number of players for this game is six. Certainly with a larger number of players the cards will frequently run out and discards will need to be recycled.\nNormally it is played with blinds: the player to dealer\'s left posts a small blind, and the next player to the left posts a big blind, equal to the mimimum bet for the game. \nThe dealer deals five cards to each player and there is a round of betting beginning to the left of the big blind. As usual in games with blinds, the big blind player is allowed to raise even if the others have all folded or called. Then in clockwise order, starting to dealer\'s left, players may discard any number of cards and are dealt replacements. There is a second round of betting begun by the first active player to dealer\'s left. This is followed by a second opportunity to discard and draw, a third round of betting, a third discard and draw, and a fourth round of betting. In a fixed limit game, the size of the bet is normally doubles after the second draw, so that the last two rounds have big bets.\nIt happens fairly often in this game that the dealer runs out of cards. In this case all the discarded cards (the "muck") are shuffled and cut to form a new deck from which replacement cards are dealt to players who are still waiting to draw.\nThere are two versions of this game, depending on the hand ranking used in the showdown (see low poker hand ranking):\n\nDeuce to Seven Triple Draw, which uses deuce-to-seven ranking, is perhaps the more popular game.\nAce to Five Triple Draw, using ace to five ranking is also sometimes played.\n\nThe Triple Draw page of the Play Lowball Poker site has further information on the history and variants of this game.\nDouble Draw\nThis game is similar to Triple Draw, except that players only have two opportunities to improve their hands by drawing cards. There are therefore three betting rounds: after the deal, after the first draw and after the second draw. Either ace-to-five or deuce-to-seven (or even ace-to-six) ranking can be used, as agreed by the players.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Lowball\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2010.

It is therefore unwise to check after the draw with such a hand, unless you intend to fold if another player bets against you.\nKansas City Lowball\nKansas City Lowball is also called Deuce to Seven Single Draw or sometimes Billy Baxter Lowball after the player who won the world championship \nin this game several times.  In this game, Aces are always high and \nstraights and flushes do count (and are therefore bad), but A-2-3-4-5 \nis not a straight, because the Ace is high.  The best hand possible is 7-5-4-3-2 (hence "Deuce\nto Seven"), followed by 7-6-4-3-2, ... K-Q-J-10-8, A-5-4-3-2, A-6-4-3-2, \n... up to the usual royal flush, which is worst.  In other words, it\'s the exact \nopposite of normal high poker except for the A-2-3-4-5 rule.\nThe deal, draw and betting are similar to California Lowball. So far as I know, this game is normally played without a joker, and there is no equivalent of the "betting sevens" rule.\nThe Deuce to Seven page of the Play Lowball Poker site has further information on this game.    \nAce-to-Six Lowball\nThis is Five Card Draw Poker using ace-to-six ranking, in which straights and flushes count but aces can be low. Normally A-A should be the lowest (and therefore best) pair, but A-K-Q-J-10 would count as a straight - but opinions may differ, so these details should be agreed in advance among the players. \nThis game is often ignored or said to be unusual in books and on poker web sites. This may be because it is not played in public card rooms on the American West Coast and rarely offered as an online game. However, I suspect it is fairly widespread in home poker games, particularly on the American East Coast and in Europe.\nTriple Draw\nIn this game players have three opportunities to improve their hand. According to some sources the maximum number of players for this game is six. Certainly with a larger number of players the cards will frequently run out and discards will need to be recycled.\nNormally it is played with blinds: the player to dealer\'s left posts a small blind, and the next player to the left posts a big blind, equal to the mimimum bet for the game. \nThe dealer deals five cards to each player and there is a round of betting beginning to the left of the big blind. As usual in games with blinds, the big blind player is allowed to raise even if the others have all folded or called. Then in clockwise order, starting to dealer\'s left, players may discard any number of cards and are dealt replacements. There is a second round of betting begun by the first active player to dealer\'s left. This is followed by a second opportunity to discard and draw, a third round of betting, a third discard and draw, and a fourth round of betting. In a fixed limit game, the size of the bet is normally doubles after the second draw, so that the last two rounds have big bets.\nIt happens fairly often in this game that the dealer runs out of cards. In this case all the discarded cards (the "muck") are shuffled and cut to form a new deck from which replacement cards are dealt to players who are still waiting to draw.\nThere are two versions of this game, depending on the hand ranking used in the showdown (see low poker hand ranking):\n\nDeuce to Seven Triple Draw, which uses deuce-to-seven ranking, is perhaps the more popular game.\nAce to Five Triple Draw, using ace to five ranking is also sometimes played.\n\nThe Triple Draw page of the Play Lowball Poker site has further information on the history and variants of this game.\nDouble Draw\nThis game is similar to Triple Draw, except that players only have two opportunities to improve their hands by drawing cards. There are therefore three betting rounds: after the deal, after the first draw and after the second draw. Either ace-to-five or deuce-to-seven (or even ace-to-six) ranking can be used, as agreed by the players.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Lowball\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2010.

Each player is dealt a seven-card hand, some of the cards being face up, with several betting rounds during the deal. At the showdown players use any five of their seven cards to make the best poker hand. Seven-card stud works well as a high-low game, and there is also a low only form known as Razz.\nThis page assumes some familiarity with the general rules and terminology of poker. See the poker rules page for an introduction to these, and the poker betting and poker hand ranking pages for further details.\nPlayers and Cards\nA standard 52-pack is used and from 2 to 8 players can take part. The game is best for 5 to 7 players. When 8 play there is the problem that the cards may run out towards the end of the deal.\nThe Play\nThe sequence of events is as follows (as usual the cards are dealt clockwise one at a time):\n\nAll players place an ante in the pot.\nEach player is dealt two cards face down and one face up. There is a betting round (third street).\nEach player is dealt a fourth card face up. There is a second betting round (fourth street).\nEach player is dealt a fifth card face up. There is a third betting round (fifth street).\nEach player is dealt a sixth card face up. There is a fourth betting round (sixth street).\nEach player is dealt one final card face down. There is a fifth betting round (seventh street).\nSurviving players have four face up and three face down cards. They show their cards and whoever can make the best five-card hand from their seven cards wins the pot.\n\nThe concealed cards - the first, second and seventh card dealt to each player - are sometimes known as "hole" cards.\nOrder of Betting\nTraditionally, each betting round is begun by the player with the best hand showing. For this purpose pairs, triplets, two pairs and quads count in their normal poker order - so for example with three cards showing 3-3-3 is higher than 7-7-8, which is higher than A-K-Q. Incomplete straights and flushes do not count. If there is a tie it is resolved by comparing the suits of the highest cards in the tied hands using the ranking order clubs (low), diamonds, hearts, spades (high).\nSome play that in the first betting round (third street), the first player must place a compulsory bet, called the bring-in. In this case there may be no ante, though an ante is usually paid as well.\nSome play that the first betting round starts with a compulsory (bring-in) bet by the player showing the lowest card. This is now the normal rule in formal games hosted by American casinos. The subsequent betting rounds from fourth street onwards are begun by the highest hand showing as usual.\nSize of Bets\nThis is of course for the players to agree. Seven Card Stud is often played as a fixed limit game with the following arrangements.\n\nA small bet and a big bet size are determined - say for example $5 and $10.\nWhen there is a compulsory bring-in bet, the ante amount is generally much smaller than the small bet - say $0.50 in the example.\nThe compulsory bring-in bet is normally less than the small bet but more than the ante - say $2 in the example.\nThe player who opens the betting has the option to place a full small bet ($5) instead of just the compulsory minimum $2.\nIf the opener just places the minimum bring-in, subsequent players have the option to complete the bet to a small bet ($5), to call the bring-in ($2) or to fold. Only if someone completes the bet are later players allowed to raise. If the opener chooses to begin with a full bet ($5), subsequent players can raise.\nIn the first betting round (third street) no big bets are allowed.\nIf there is no compulsory bet in the first betting round, then a larger ante should be used, and only full small bets are allowed in the first betting round.\nOnly one bet and a maximum of three raises are allowed in any betting round, if there were more than two active players at the start of the betting round. A bring-in of less than a small bet does not count as a bet for this purpose - after it is completed there can be three raises.\nFrom fourth street onward, big bets ($10) are allowed if any player has a pair (or better) showing. In this case anyone can place a big bet or raise, even if they do not themselves have a pair.\nNote that if the rule is played that each raise must be at least as large as the last bet or raise, then after a player places a big bet, only big raises are allowed in that round. However, many home poker games do not have this rule, in which case a player may respond to a big bet with a small raise, thereby "using up" one of the three raises and limiting the potential size of the pot.\nSome play that from fifth street onwards, only big bets are allowed. This is the normal rule in casino hosted games, but not in home poker games.\n\nRunning Out of Cards\nIf there are eight players and after sixth street no one has folded, there will not be enough cards to deal everyone a seventh card. In this case a single "community" card is dealt face up to the table and this counts as everyone\'s seventh card. Everyone then effectively has five cards showing, including the community card, and seventh street betting is begun by the player for whom this makes the highest poker hand - straights and flushes not count. Ties are resolved by the suit of the highest card as usual.\nIn formal games it is usual for the dealer to "burn" one card - placing the top card of the deck face down under the pot - at each stage of the deal. In this case the card can run out even with only seven players. If the dealer determines that there are not enough cards to complete the deal, the burned cards are retrieved from under the pot and shuffled with the remains of the deck, and if possible a card is then dealt to each player.\nNote that in no case are cards discarded by a player who has folded returned to the deck to be dealt. These cards are dead.    \nSeven Card Stud High-Low\nThe deal and betting are mostly the same as in ordinary seven card stud. Some play that in high-low games,  a pair showing does not give players the option of a big bet or raise.\nAt the showdown, each player selects five cards to make a high hand and five possibly different cards to make a low hand. The pot is split equally between the highest and lowest hands, the odd chip going to the high hand if the amount cannot be divided exactly by two. Any of the possible low hand ranking methods can be used - see low hand ranking on the poker hand ranking page.\nSince different selections of cards can be used for the high and low hands, it is entirely possible for one player to win both halves of the pot.\nIn formal games, the rule is that "the cards speak for themselves". That is - at the showdown each player is entitled to compete with the highest and lowest hand that can be made from his or her seven cards, even if the player does not correctly identify the best selections of five cards.\nEight or Better\nIn formal games there is often a qualification rule that a low hand cannot contain any card higher than an 8. In this case the ace-to-five system of low hand ranking is used. This variant is called Seven Card Stud Hi-Lo Eight or Better, often abbreviated to Seven-Stud/8. If none of the players has a qualifying low hand at the showdown, the high hand wins the whole pot.\nWith Declare\nIn home games, Seven Card Stud High-Low is often played with declaration. After the seventh street betting round each player has to declare either "high", "low" or "both". This can be done either in sequence around the table or simultaneously. In the simultaneous method each player holds out a closed fist containing  one chip for "high", no chips for "low" or two chips for "both", and when all are ready, everyone reveals their choice. \nIn the showdown, if no one declared "both", the highest hand among the players who have declared "high" shares the pot with the lowest of the players who have declared "low". If all declare "high" or all declare "low", the winner  takes the whole pot. A player who declared "both" has to have the highest hand or all the "high" and "both" players and the lowest hand of all the "both" and "low" players to win the whole pot. A "both" player who loses or ties either high or low cannot win any part of the pot.\nSee the sections on declaration methods and the showdown in split pot games on the poker betting page for further details and variations.\nRazz\nRazz is seven card stud played for low only, using ace-to-five ranking (see hand ranking in low poker). In the first betting round the compulsory bring-in bet is made by the owner of the highest card showing. In subsequent rounds, from fourth street onwards, the lowest hand showing bets first. Ace is low and king high throughout, and as usual the suit of the highest card is used to break ties, so if on fourth street two players tie for lowest with 6-2 and 6-2 the second hand will start the betting, because the six of clubs is lower than the diamond.\nIn fixed limit games the limits double at fifth street: on third and fourth street only small bets are allowed, and from fifth street onwards only big bets. Pairs showing have no effect on the size of bets.\nThe RAZZ page of the Play Lowball Poker site has further information on the history and variants of this game.\nLondon Lowball\nLondon Lowball is seven card stud played for low only, using ace-to-six ranking (see hand ranking in low poker). \nNormally a pot limit betting structure is used (see betting limits).\nSeven Card Stud with Wild Cards\nIn home poker, seven card stud is often played with wild cards, which of course increases the frequency of the higher hand types. In the simplest case the wild cards can be all cards of a certain rank, as agreed by the players or specified by the dealer in a dealer\'s choice game - for example seven card stud, deuces wild. The game with wild cards can of course also be played high-low or low only.\nThere are also some more elaborate seven-card stud variants in which the wild cards are determined by the players\' cards in the course of the deal.\nLow Hole\nThis game, also known as Late Show, is seven card stud in which each player\'s lowest concealed card is wild for that player only. That means for example that if your first three cards are 9-4 face down and 3 face up, all your fours will be wild unless your seventh card, which will also be face down, is a 3 or a 2, making that rank wild instead.\nLow Hole is normally played as a high game, but can also be played low or high-low. In the case of high-low, if you use ace-to-six or ace-to-five ranking of low hands, then an ace in the hole will make aces wild for the purpose of low hands but not for high hands.\nEnglish Stud\nSix players are the maximum for this variant, in which players can improve their hands by substituting cards.\nDeal, play and betting are the same as in seven-card stud up to the point where each player has five cards (two down and three up). After the subsequent betting round and before the sixth card is dealt, each player in turn, starting with the player to dealer\'s left, has the option to exchange any one card. The player may either discard a down card and be dealt a new down card or discard an up card and be dealt a new up card, or choose to stand pat and not exchange any card. Then a sixth card is dealt to each player face up, there is a betting round and another round of exchanging. There is a final betting round followed by a showdown.\nVariations\nIf there are five or fewer players, a seventh face-down card can be dealt, as in seven-card stud.\nSome set a price for exchanging, which may be equal to the minimum bet at that point. In this case, anyone who exchanges must pay that amount to the pot. This does not count as a bet and does not have to be matched by the other players.\nAces, Straights and Flushes\nBrian Johnson describes this game, in which each player is dealt six cards and there is a joker in the centre of the table that acts as everyone\'s seventh card. The joker is not fully wild, but functions rather like the "bug" in 5-card draw. It can represent an ace, or a card needed to complete a player\'s straight or flush, but cannot be used to form a set of equal cards other than aces. Deal and betting are the same as in seven-card stud up to the point where each player has five cards (two down and three up). After the ensuing betting round each player gets one last face down card and there is a final betting round.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Seven Card Stud\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2010, 2011.

Another version of Agram is played in the northern part of\nMali in the cities of Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal. It has also spread to Cameroon where it is known as Fapfap. These games are related to Spar or Sipa, which is played in Ghana and some other West African countries, and is probably descended from a European game introduced at the time of the slave trade.\nAgram in Niger\nPlayers and Cards\nAgram is a game for 2 or more players, using 35 cards\n      from a standard international 52-card pack. The Kings, Queens, Jacks and Twos of all\n      suits and the Ace of spades are removed from the deck. The cards\n      of each suit rank, from high to low: A, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. Because the\n      Ace of Spades called \'Chief \' is removed from the deck, the highest \n      card in the  spade suit is the 10. \nThe game is played counter-clockwise.\nDeal\n The first to deal is any player chosen by agreement; thereafter the winner\n      of previous game deals next. \nThe dealer shuffles. The player on his right cuts the cards. The dealer deals six cards to each player in batches of 3.\nPlay\n The next player after the dealer (the player to dealer\'s right) leads any card, playing it face up in the\n      middle of the playing area. \nThe other players, in turn, must play a card\n      of the same suit if they can; those who have no card of the suit led play\n      any card they choose. When all have played one card, the first trick\n      is complete. Whoever played the highest card of the suit that the first\n      player led is the winner of the trick. \nThe winner of the trick leads any\n      card from his hand to begin the next trick, playing it face up on top\n      of the pile, and once again the other players must each play a card:\n      this must be the same suit as the card that was led, if possible, otherwise\n      any card. \nThis continues until six tricks have been played.\n      Whoever wins the sixth and last trick wins the game.\nSink-Sink in Niger\nThis game is identical to Agram, described above, except that each player is dealt five cards instead of six: a batch of three cards followed by a batch of two. The same 35-card pack is used and the winner of the fifth and last trick wins the game.\nFapfap in Cameroon\nThis game has recently come to Cameroon from Niger. Like Sink-Sink, it is similar to Agram except that each player is dealt five cards rather than six. In Cameroon, players normally play their cards in a face up pile in front of themselves rather than to a common pile in the centre of the table.\nThe winner of  the fifth and last trick wins as follows:\n\na  quadruple stake for winning the last two tricks with 3s;\n a double stake for  winning only the last trick with a 3;\na  single stake for winning the last trick with any other card: 4 or higher.\n\nAgram in Mali\n    Agram in Mali is a game for 2 or more players, using 31 cards\n      from a standard international 52-card pack (6, 5, 4, 3, 2 of all\n      suits and the Ace of spades are removed from the deck). \nThe cards\n      of each suit have very unusual ranking, namely, from high to low: A, K,\n      10, Q, 9, 8, J, 7. Because the Ace of Spades is removed from the deck,\n      the highest card in the suit of spades is King. \nThe deal and play are the same as in Niger, except that in Mali just five cards are dealt to each player: a batch of two cards each and then a batch of three cards each. The winner of the fifth and last trick wins the game and deals next. \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Last Trick group > Agram\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2011.

To make this more difficult, there is a rule that in each trick players must either overtake or sacrifice their lowest card. To be safe from losing, you therefore need not only a low card for the last trick, but also high cards for overtaking, so that your low card(s) do not have to be given up prematurely.\nCucumber appears to be a fairly recent game. It is played in several North European countries and was popular with students in the 1970\'s and 1980\'s. In the 1975 edition of the Swedish book Kortoxen by Einar Werner and Tore Sandgren, Gurka is described as "a comparatively new game". It does not appear in the 1949 edition, but was presumably introduced between these dates, since a translation is included as Kurkku in the 1970 Finnish book Pelataan korttia  by Tore Sandgren. A very similar game  Krypkille is played in Sweden with Kille cards. This game was already described in the 1949 edition of Werner and Sandgren\'s Kortoxen, and it seems likely that Cucumber originated as an adaptation of Krypkille to be played with the standard 52-card pack.\nThere are many  somewhat different versions of Cucumber: the rules vary from country to country, and also within each country. This page describes forms played in Denmark (Agurk), Sweden (Gurka), Poland (Ogrek), Finland (Kurkku or  Mtpes), Norway (Gurka) and Iceland (Grka). There are probably other versions, and variations described as played in any of these places may perhaps also be found in the others. The Danish game will be described in full, followed by the differences found in the other versions.\nAgurk (Danish)\nAgurk is the Danish word for cucumber; the game is also sometimes known as 21, since a player with more than 21 points loses.  The game was played extensively at DIKU in the 1970s. The following description is  based mainly on a contribution from Jens Brix Christiansen.\nProcedure\n\nAgurk is played with an ordinary deck of 52 cards.  From 2 to 7 players participate.  The cards are ranked from high to low A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, ..., 2; the suits have no significance.  Cards are shuffled by the dealer and then dealt 7 at a time, face down, clockwise, starting with forehand (i.e., the player to the left of the dealer).  The cards that are not dealt are set aside and seen by no one.\n\n\nSeven tricks are played.  The cards played are simply placed on the table face-up in front of each player; the cards are neither collected nor turned over after each trick. Any player may inspect any of the cards played to previous tricks. Forehand leads to the first trick; the winner of each trick leads to the next trick.  Once a card is led, the remaining players each play a card to the trick in clockwise rotation. \n\nThe lead can be chosen freely.  The other players in turn have a choice between: \n\nplaying any card whose rank is at least as high as the highest card so far played to the trick, or\nplaying their lowest ranking card.  \n\nThe highest ranking card wins the trick; if there are several of these, the last of them to be played wins the trick.\n\n\nThe turn to deal passes clockwise after each hand. If the player whose turn it should be to deal has been eliminated from the game (see below), then the dealer is the next player in rotation who is still in the game.\n\n\nScoring\n\nThe player who wins the last trick loses the deal and is penalized. Each player\'s score is the running total of the penalties he has accumulated. The losing player on a deal receives as many penalty points as the rank of the card taking the last trick (A=14, K=13, Q=12, J=11, spot cards according the number of spots). \nWhen a player\'s score reaches or exceeds 21, he loses a life; in the score, a cucumber is drawn to signify this.  He is then reincarnated with the highest score that any other player currently has accumulated.  The second time a player\'s score reaches or exceeds 21, he loses his life permanently and no longer participates in the game.  Eventually, only two players remain; they continue to play until one of them loses his second life.  The sole survivor is the winner of the game.\n\n\nIf any other players play in the last trick a card of the same rank as the card played by the loser of the deal, these other players are awarded a bonus of the same size as the penalty incurred by the loser.  The bonus is deducted from the player\'s score. (Example: in the last trick of a six player game, the cards played are 5, 9, 3, 9, 9, 7, in that order. The fifth player wins the trick with the last 9 and gets 9 penalty points; the second and fourth players each have a bonus of 9 points subtracted from their scores).\n\n  \nBonuses cannot lower a player\'s score below zero. For players on their second life, a bonus cannot lower their score below a cucumber and zero.  Bonuses are deducted only after the loser\'s score is added.  Thus in a two-person game where both players are at 18, and both players play a 10 to the last trick, the score for the loser is first changed to cucumber and 18, after which the bonus changes the other player\'s score to 8. \n\nThe winner goes on to deal the first deal of the next game. \n\n\nStrategy\n\nThe best possible hand is four aces, two kings, and a low card.  As forehand, you can lead your four aces, stripping all the other players of their four lowest cards, and continuing with your kings is bound to do significant damage. A hand of twos and threes is a boring hand, that will not engage its holder much.  A hand of tens and jacks usually heralds catastrophe.\n\nThe simplest strategy is to try to survive each deal without taking the last trick.  This is done by estimating at what level the last trick is likely to be taken and playing to get rid of cards at or above that level.  To play this way is called to fimp.  Fimping is an inferior strategy in the long run.  Among seasoned players, "fimp" is a derogatory word.  Even so, with inferior cards, fimping is the only available strategy.\n\n\nIf all players fimp, the rank of the last trick will be low, and the loser will incur an insignificant penalty.  If, instead, the players with high cards (aces, kings, and with fewer than three players, maybe also queens and jacks) consistently lead their high cards, the unfortunate players without high cards will be forced to discard their low cards early in the game, thus raising the rank of the last trick. This is known as "playing sharp" (no connotation of dishonesty intended). In deals played sharp, a number of players form an alliance to ensure that someone is caught with a much higher card.  The rationale behind this strategy is that when someone else is penalized, it should be as severely as possible.  Playing sharp with good cards is a superior strategy in the long run; but you don\'t always hold good cards.\n\nThe game is often quite noisy.  This means that alliances actually can be suggested orally during play.  This includes bluffing, of course. It is not obvious whether the talking makes any difference to the actual play, since alliances are implicit anyway.\n\nThe two-person game, to which every game boils down, is quite different from the many-person game and surprisingly difficult to learn to play well.\n\nThe winning strategy in the long run is to play sharp almost always but to defect from an alliance of sharp players occasionally (when the cards are hopeless for sharp play).  When played by experienced players, the game takes on many of the characteristics of the prisoner\'s dilemma.\n\n\nVariants\nSome players use a 55-card pack including three jokers. Jokers are then the highest cards, ranking above aces, and count as 15 points.\nSome play that after the deal, the player to dealer\'s left (the first player) can discard a number of unwanted cards. He then draws an equal number of replacement cards from the top of the undealt part of the pack. Each of the other players in turn then has the option to discard the same number of cards as the first player and replenish their hands. You are not allowed to discard a different number of cards from the first player, but you may opt not to discard but to play with your original hand. If the first player does not discard, no one else is allowed to discard. If there are fewer cards remaining in the undealt pack than the first player exchanged, the next player must discard as many cards as remain in the pack or none at all. If the undealt cards run out, later players cannot discard at all.\nSome players keep score by leaving the losing card of each hand face up on the table in front of the person who played it. There is no bonus for having a card equal to the losing card. A player whose cards add up to more than 21 drops out of the game - there is no second life.\nSome play that if there is a tie for highest card at the end of a hand, all players holding those high cards lose that number of points, which may be indicated by keeping the cards in front of them, if you score that way.\nSome play that the game ends as soon as any player goes over 21, and that player is the loser, rather than continuing until all but one player has been knocked out.\nSome play that a player whose score reaches 21 points exactly has his score reset to zero (he puts all his scoring cards back in the pack).\nSome play that instead of always dealing seven cards, from the second hand onwards the number of cards dealt to each player is the value of the losing card from the previous hand. So if a hand is lost with a jack, 11 cards each are dealt and 11 tricks played. If a two loses, players get only two cards each.\nGurka (Swedish)\nGurka is the Swedish word for cucumber. According to the earliest known account, in Werner and Sandgren\'s Kortoxen, the Swedish game Gurka was originally played in a rather similar way to the Danish game above. \nA standard 52-card pack is used, ranking from ace (high) to two (low) and there can be from 3 to 8 players. At the start of the game everyone pays an equal stake into a pot, which is collected by the eventual winner. Six cards are dealt to each player, one at a time, clockwise. Play is clockwise, beginning with the player to dealer\'s left.\nAny card may be led. Other players in turn must either play a card that is at least as high as the highest card so far played to the trick, or play their lowest card. The trick is won by the highest card played to it, and if several equally high cards are played, by the last of those. \nWhoever has the highest card in the last trick scores that many penalty points (J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14). If two or more players have equally high cards in the last trick they all score that number of penalty points. Any player who reaches a cumulative score of 30 points is out of the game: the player is said to be a cucumber, or to have flown. However, there is the option to buy back into the game for a second stake. \nEach player has one opportunity to "buy in", provided that there are are at least three other players remaining in the game at the time. The player pays another stake to the pot (equal the  original stake), and the player\'s score is reset to equal the highest score (most penalty points) of any of the other players who is still in the game. The normal time to buy in is just after you have been eliminated, but it might also make sense to buy in at some other time. For example if you lose the first two deals with a 10 and a jack and everyone else is still on zero, you could pay to have your score reset to zero. There is no obligation to buy in: if you reach 30 or more you can simply accept your defeat and leave the game. For example, if the other players\' scores were 0-5-28-2 it would probably be unwise to buy in for a score of 28. You can only buy in once, if your score goes over 30 after you have bought in  you are finally eliminated from the game until after the pot has been won.\nThis seems to have been the original version but there have been several significant changes in the rules. My thanks to Johan Pettersson and Dan Glimne for their help in collecting and analysing these changes.\n\n Only the previous player\'s card must be beaten \nThe most important change is in the rules of play. In Sweden most, or possibly all players now use the rule that you must either beat or equal the previous player\'s card or play your lowest card. It is not necessary to beat the highest card in the trick. Example: the first player plays a king, the second player equals it with a king, the third player, having no ace or king, is forced to play his lowest card, a three. The fourth player having Q-7-2 is allowed to play the 7, because it beats the 3.\nMy impression is that this rule might have arisen from a misunderstanding of the account in Kortoxen, in which the rules is ambiguously stated, and the intention that the highest card in the trick must be beaten is only clear if one studies the example of play that is provided. However, Hans-Olof Halln of the Sknes Bridgefederation asserts that from the beginning the requirement was only to beat the immediately previous card.\n Must beat the previous card when possible  \nSome play that each player must beat or equal the previous player\'s card if they can. Only a player who is unable to beat the previous card must play his or her lowest card. This rule is by no means universal. Many allow players the option to play their lowest card even when able to beat the previous card.\n Aces cannot beat aces  \nA newer rule, now widely played, is that when an ace is played, the next player must play his or her lowest card. All other cards can be "beaten" by an equal card, but an ace cannot be played immediately after another ace to beat it.\n Lowest card must be led  \nSome people now play that when leading to a trick you must play your lowest card.\n Target score and rebuys  \nSome play to a score of 20 rather than 30. Some play with a fixed stake, and each player has one free rebuy.\n\nOgrek (Polish)\nA distinctive feature of the Polish version of Cucumber, known as Ogrek, is that although the ace is the highest card during the first five tricks, in the last trick it becomes the lowest card, worth 1 point. This was the standard rule when I played in Warsaw in 1980, and the same rule was given in the Ogrek page of the Students Circle of Mathematicians at the Uniwersytet Jagielloski in Krakow, on which the following description is based.  \n The game is played with a 52-card pack, or more than one such deck if there are more than 8 players. Six cards are dealt to each player. The player to dealer\'s left leads any card to the first trick. Subsequent players in clockwise order must beat or equal the highest card in the trick if able to do so. Any player unable to equal or beat the highest card must play his or her lowest card. Whoever plays the highest card, or the last of equally high cards, leads to the next trick. \nIn the last trick, whoever plays the highest card receives penalty points according to the value of the card. In the last trick only, the ace is low and counts as 1 point. 2 to 10 are face value, J=11, Q=12, K=13. If several players have equally high cards, they all receive that number of penalty points. Players whose scores reach 50 points or more drop out of the game and the last surviving player is the winner.\nVariations\nThe UJ maths students site lists the following variations, among others:\nClassic Ogrek - played to 21 points rather than 50.\nOgrek with Kontra. After the deal the players speak in turn, beginning to dealer\'s left, saying either "pass" or "kontra". This continues until either someone says "kontra" or all have passed. If someone said kontra, the number of penalty points given to the loser(s) is doubled. If the player who said "kontra" loses, that player receives quadruple penalty points. If you say kontra and then lose with a king, you get a penalty of 52 (413) and lose the whole game in one hand.\nKurkku / Mtpes / Rassi (Finnish)\nIn Finland, versions of Cucumber are played under several names. The book Pelataan korttia by Tore Sandgren (1970) gives under the name Kurkku (Cucumber) a Finnish translation of the Swedish rules for Gurka as in Kortoxen , so it may be assumed that the games in Finland and Sweden were similar at this time. The same play example is given, so the implication is that players must either beat the highest card in the trick or play their lowest.\nCristian Seres had similar rules on the Kurkku page of his Finnish card game website Korttipelien sntj in a description contributed by  Ohto Salo. There are a couple of differences: the number of players suggested is 3 or 4, not more, and it seems that the game ends as soon as any player reaches 30, with the player having the lowest score at that time declared the winner.\nPekka Ranta\'s  book Marjapussissa Porvooseen (1993) includes a simple variant called \n  Mtpes (Dirty Nest), which  Anthony Smith has kindly translated. The number of players is not specified; they are dealt an equal number of cards from a standard 52-card pack. The implication seemed to be that you should deal as many cards as possible - for example 7 each to 7 players - since the undealt cards are to be shown to the players after the deal. As usual the player to dealer\'s left leads to the first trick, and players must either equal or beat the highest card in the trick or play their lowest card. The highest card or the last of equally high cards wins the trick and the winner leads to the next trick. The winner of the last trick loses, and as a penalty must deal the next hand - the expression is "jaa kortit ja opi pelaaman" ("deal the cards and learn to play!"). No scoring system is given.\nAnother Kurkku variation is described on a web page by  Antti Louko, under the name Kurko (King), which is somewhat confusing, since "King" is also the name of another card game. Kurko is played by 2 to 9 players with a 54-card pack including two or three jokers, from which six cards are dealt to each player. Players are forced to equal or beat the highest card in the trick if they can; only if they are unable to do this are they forced to play their lowest card. The jokers function exactly like aces, and as in the Polish game Ogrek the aces and jokers count as the highest cards in the first five tricks, but as the lowest cards, worth just 1 point, in the last trick. In this variant, players are not eliminated, but all carry on playing until all players but one have a score of 30 points or more. The game then ends with the player on the lowest score as the winner, and all other payers pay the winner in proportion to the difference between their scores.\nOn his web page, Cristian Seres includes a variation Rassi, contributed by  Tuomo Vliaho. As I understand it "rassi" means cleaning, and according to Antti Louko\'s glossary it is the term for what happens when a player leads an ace, forcing everyone else to give up their lowest card. \n\nIn Rassi, after dealing six cards to each player, the dealer asks "is it free?". Any players who have no picture cards (king, queen, jack) can at this point throw in their cards and receive a new six-card hand. \nNext the dealer asks for "doubles?", at which point any player may discard all six cards and receive a new hand of six cards. Any player who has taken advantage of the opportunity to "double" will suffer a double penalty if he or she has the highest card on the last trick.\nAfter any double, the dealer offers the player the chance to "redouble" - to discard all six cards again and receive another new hand. A player who loses after redoubling loses four times the usual number of penalty points.\nIt is possible for a player who begins with no pictures in hand to exchange cards three times, for "free", "double" and "redouble".\nIn this game, aces are high in the first five tricks, but low, counting 1 point, in the last trick. A player whose score reaches 50 is eliminated and the last surviving player wins.\n\nGurka (Norwegian)\nNorwegian Gurka is very similar to the Danish game. It is played with 52 cards and 7 cards dealt to each person. According to a post on the skillsrinet forum there are a few differences:\n\nA player who reaches 21 points is immediately eliminated from the game - there is no second life.\nThere is no bonus for playing a card equal to the loser\'s card in the last trick. \nJokers can be added to the deck, in which case they function as extra aces.\nAlternatively, some play that an ace cannot be played on an ace. Since aces may then be played on four separate tricks, this results in a tenser game where the losing card may be quite high.\n\nNick Vidargas has described a variant that he learned under the name Norwegian, so it may well correspond to another   version of Gurka played in Norway. The differences from the above game are as follows:\n\nIn the first hand, 5 cards each are dealt. Subsequently the number of cards dealt is equal to the value of the card held by the loser of the previous hand, with a maximum deal of 7 cards each.\nAs in some Danish variants, the dealer may discard some cards, keeping at least two, and draw replacements. If the dealer does this, each of the other players has the option to exchange the same number of cards as the dealer or play with their original hand. \nThe dealer plays first, and the player of the lowest card in the last trick, and the first of these if several are equally low, deals the next hand.\nWhen counting the loser\'s score  all pictures and aces count as 11.\n\nGrka (Icelandic)\nAn Icelandic version of Cucumber is described at spilareglur.is and Anthony Smith has kindly provided a translation. This version is unusual in that it is possible to lead several cards at the same time, and that the 6 is the highest card. \nFrom 2-4 players play with a  52-card pack in which the cards rank from Ace (high) down to Two (low) as usual, except for the  six of clubs, which is higher than all other cards including aces. In the first hand, 10 cards are dealt to each player, in the second hand 9 cards, and so on, reducing the hand size by one in each new deal.\nThe player to the left of the dealer begins and  may lead a single card or any number of equal cards - for example two eights or three jacks. If a single card is led, the rule is the same as in Denmark and elsewhere: subsequent players must beat or equal the highest card in the trick or play their lowest card. If more than one card is led, subsequent players must each player an equal number of cards. These cards need not be equal to each other, but they must be at least as high as the highest set of cards so far played to the trick, or the  lowest cards that the player has. For example if 5-5-5 is led, the next player might play 5-9-J, on which the following player could play 8-Q-K. The fourth player, holding for example 2, 2, 4, 7, 7, J, J, A cannot play higher or equal; having used the ace to  beat the king there is no other card in the hand that is as good as the queen. Therefore this player would be forced to play 2-2-4.\nThe trick is won by the player of the highest card or set, or by the last of equally high cards or sets, and the winner leads to the next trick. Players must keep a single card for the last trick. Even if your last cards are equal - for example a pair of 4\'s - you cannot lead them both at once. The winner of the final single card trick scores a penalty equal to the value of that card (Ace=14, King=13, Queen=12, Jack=11, 10-2 face value). This is indicated by storing the losing card in front of the player while the remaining cards are shuffled for the next deal. There is no bonus for having a card equal to the losing card. The 6 has a value of 21 points.\nA player who has a total score of more than 21 (as indicated by the sum of the cards in front of the player) drops out of the game, while the remaining players continue playing. The last surviving player is the winner.\nA player who has a score of exactly 21 points returns to zero and remains in the game. The player\'s scoring cards are shuffled back into the pack.\nNote that a player who has the 6 as the last card will lose the hand since this is the highest card in the pack. If the player has previously lost a hand, this will take the player\'s score over 21 and the player is eliminated from the game. On the other hand if the player has no previous scoring cards, the 6 creates a score of 21 which becomes 0 and the player stays in the game.\nVariants\nSome play that before leading to the first trick, the player to dealer\'s left may discard some cards and draw an equal number of replacements from the undealt cards. In that case each other player has the opportunity to discard and draw  before the play begins, with the restriction that the number of cards discarded must be less than or equal to the number discarded by the first player.\nSome play with the two black sevens as equal high cards, in which case  the six of clubs is just an ordinary six. In one version the 7 is highest, counting 16 points and the 7 is second highest, counting 15 points. In another, the two black sevens are equal highest, counting 21 points each.\nSome play with the Swedish rule that it is only necessary to beat the previous card, not the highest card in the trick.\nSome play with just 5 cards dealt to each player throughout. Some play with a different sequence of deals: first 6 cards each, then reducing one card at a time to 1, then increasing to 5, reducing to 1, increasing to 4, reducing to 1, etc. The result of a 1-card deal is of course pure chance.\nOther Versions\nThere is an American variant twenty-two, which is quite similar to Icelandic Cucumber except that the six of clubs is not a special card. This is described on a separate page.\nBarry Rigal has described some variants played at the 2004 European Junior Bridge Championship in Prague.  Since this was an international event, these probably reflect the practice in various countries. Some played with the variant described in the Swedish section above in which an ace forces the next player to play their lowest card. Some allowed players to choose whether to beat or equal the highest (or previous) card or to play their lowest card; others played by the rule that one must equal or beat the highest card if one can. Some played that one must play the lowest card one has that equals or beats the previous card, and holding no such card play one\'s lowest card: this removes all choice from the players except the decision of which card to lead to a trick. Some played that all players holding the highest card in the last trick score that number as a penalty; others that only the last of those players took a penalty.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Last Trick group > Cucumber\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1997, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014.

Gumundsson, 1989, Reykjavk. Clarification of "friufr" from "Islandsk-Dansk Ordbog", Reykjavk 1920-24.\n\nThe name "Alkort" has a foreign ring, yet it must have\nbeen among the oldest games on Iceland. Eggert lafsson\n(1726-1768) said it was native. Here is laf\nDavsson\'s work describing the game, from his writings\non Icelandic amusements (slenzkar gtur, skemmtanir,\nvikavikar og ulur", lafur Davsson,\n1887-1903, Copenhagen). Two sorts of Alkort were played, 4-man\nAlkort and 2-man Alkort. They are very similar and we describe\nhere the basic game, 4-man Alkort.\nNumber of Players and the Pack\n\nAs the name 4-man Alkort implies, this is a game for four, who\nplay in two partnerships of two. An ordinary pack of cards is\nneeded but the 10s and 5s are taken out (leaving 44 cards).\nThe Ranking of the Cards\n\nThe ranking of cards in Alkort is very different from the usual ranking. The KD is highest (except when a 7 is led); then in order 2H, 4C, 8S, 9H, 9D. Next come the Aces, then the Jacks, the Sixes (pstarnir) and the Eights (friurnar) except 8S.\n\nThe other cards are all useless rubbish which are not worth having, except that a player who leads a rubbish card wins the trick if the other three cards played are also rubbish. The Kings (except KD) and the Queens are however the lowest of all these, because you may take a King with a Two or a Queen with a Two or a Three, provided no valuable card is played to the trick.\n\nThe Sevens (bsefarnir) have special status. When they are led no card can beat them, but on the other hand they are utterly useless when following because they cannot beat any other\ncard. You may not lead out a Seven until you have taken a trick. \n\nThe Deal\n\nCut for partners and for deal. After shuffling and cutting each\nplayer is dealt 9 cards in batches of 3, clockwise. The stock\nwhich is left over is placed face down on the table and no one\nmay see it. It contains 8 cards.\n\nA player who is dealt no card which would be capable of beating one of the three low Eights (friurnar) if a low Eight were led is said to be not friufr (not 8-capable). Such a player may show all his cards, discard them all except one, and take up instead the 8 cards which form the stock.\n\nThe Course of the Game\n\nBefore play begins, partners show each other their highest card. Forehand leads first and the others follow in clockwise order. The highest card played takes the trick. If two or more equally high cards are played (e.g. two jacks or two aces or two rubbish)\nthen the one played earliest to the trick counts as highest.\n\nThe goal of the game is to take as many tricks as possible - 5\nor more to win. If a partnership takes 5 before the others take\na trick then they "mk" or make them "mk".\nIf they take more than 5 tricks before their opponents win any\nthey are said to have made a stroke. The stroke is called\na 6-card, 7-card, 8-card or 9-card stroke according to the number\nof tricks taken by the winners before the opponents take one.\nSettlement\n\nFor a simple win, i.e. 5 or more tricks, but not the first 5 tricks, one point is scored.\n\nFor "mk", i.e. winning the first 5 tricks, five points are scored.\n\nFor a stroke, the winners score as many points as there are tricks in the stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Trump group > Karnffel Group > Alkort\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1998.

Dominic C. Armanino states that this game started in Europe, but it is now more popular in the United States.  It is also sometimes known as Double Six, Muggins, Five Up or Single Spinner, but here we use the name Muggins for the game played without a spinner and Five Up for the game in which all doubles are spinners.\nEquipment\nThe game uses a double six domino set.  It can be played by two to four players, but  is best as a four handed partnership game.  A cribbage board is useful for scoring, since scores are totaled as they are made and not at the end of the hand. If no cribbage board is available, the score can be kept on paper.\nThe Deal\nThe size of the hand varies with the number of players:\n\n\n2 players get 9 tiles each\n3 players get 7 tiles each\n4 players get 5 tiles each \n\nThe rest of the tiles form the boneyard.\nThe four handed game is usually played in partnerships. \nThe Play\nThe first player in the first hand is determined by lot.  In the following hands, the player who dominoed in the previous hand plays first.  If the last hand was blocked, then the lead is again determined by lot.  The lead can be any tile in the player\'s hand.\nThe following players must play a tile matching the free end of one of the tiles at the ends of the layout.  Doubles are played crosswise and count as the total of their pips for scoring purposes so long as they are at the end of one of the arms of the layout, with no tile yet played against the other side of the double.\nThe first double, and only the first double, played is used as a \'spinner\': the first and second tiles played against the spinner must be placed against a side, then the third and fourth tiles must be placed against the ends.\nIf a player cannot play a tile, he must draw tiles from the boneyard until he has a tile which will play or the boneyard is empty.  When he draws a tile which will play, it goes on the table immediately and his turn ends.  If he empties the boneyard and still cannot play, he passes and the next player takes his turn.\nThe hand continues until one player dominoes (plays his last tile) or until all players are blocked.\nScoring\nAfter a player has set a tile, the two, three or four ends of the tableau are totaled.  If this total is a multiple of five (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 35 points), the player immediately scores that number of points.  A  double on the end of an arm of the tableau scores the total of its pips; that is [5-5] is worth ten points in the total, [6-6] is worth twelve points and so forth.\nThe first double (spinner) is scored in the same way. Both ends count until tiles have been placed against both of its sides. When the second tile is played against the spinner, the spinner no longer contributes to the score: only the tiles at the two ends of the layout count, just as if the spinner was another tile placed in line.  This can be confusing because the ends of the spinner are still open for setting other tiles. \nWhen the third tile is played against the spinner, creating a new arm extending from one of its ends, this third arm also counts towards the total, and when the fourth arm is begun by by extending the other end of the spinner all four ends count.\nWhen the hand is finished by being dominoed, the player who ran out of tiles (or that player\'s team) is considered the winner of that deal. If it is blocked the player or team with least points on dominoes remaining in hand is considered the winner. The winning player or team scores the total of the pips on the tiles remaining in the opponents\' hands, rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of five.  For example, in a two-player game a losing hand with just the [1-2] would round to five points, while [1-1] would round down to zero points. \nIf there is a tie for least points in a blocked two-player or four-player game no one scores for the remaining tiles. In a three-player game if two players tie for least they split the third player\'s points between them.\nThe game is played for an agreed upon number of points, usually 250 points for two players and 200 points with three or four players.\nIt is common to divide all the scores by five, so that for example a total of 15 on the ends of the layout scores 3 points. The game can then be scored on a Cribbage board, and the winning target is 61 points. \nN.W. Holsey and Ken Tidwell describe anelegant method of scoring on paper. It begins with two lines crossing to form a large X Each line is worth 5 points so the X represents 10. Further points are represented by a small x in each of the four spaces around the large X: again each line is worth 5 and each small x 10, so that when the four small x\'s are complete the whole symbol is worth 50 points, and a new large X is begun. This method of scoring is quick, reliable and easy to read.\nVariations\nYou will find many local variations as to how to pick the first player for a hand, what tiles can be lead, what score to play to, and the size of the hands.  These are not significant changes in the basic game.  One European source gives this table for the size of the hands:\n\n2 players get 7 tiles each \n3 players get 5 tiles each \n4 players get 5 tiles each \n\nThe rest of the tiles form the boneyard.\nIn The Dominologist (New York,  Bloomington, Shanghai  2008) Nathan  W. Holsey recommends the following hand sizes: \n\n2 players get 7 tiles each if they are beginners, or 9 tiles each for a more demanding game.\n3 players get 7 tiles each, or 9 each leaving just one tile in the boneyard.\n4 players get 5 tiles each, or 7 each leaving no talon.\n\nSome play that the last tile or the last two tiles in the boneyard can never be drawn. If the boneyard is reduced to one (or two) tiles players who cannot play must pass and if all pass the game is blocked.\nSome play that a player or team must reach the target score (for example 61 on a cribbage board) exactly in order to win. This can happen during the play by playing a tile that makes a multiple of five on the ends of the layout or by scoring for the opponents\' tiles at the end of a game. If a player overshoots by scoring too maky points at once - for example 4 points from a score of 58 - those points are not scored and the game continues.\nSome play that at the end of a hand each player or team subtracts the total pip value of the tiles remaining in their hands, rounded to the nearest five, from their running total. This variant does not lend itself so well to scoring on a cribbage board or with Holsey and Tidwell\'s X\'s.\nComments & Strategy\nThis is one of the best domino games, because the strategy is complicated, but play is fast.  Here are some general hints:\nAs in any domino game, the player who can count the outstanding tiles has a strong advantage.\nBeginning players have trouble doing the required math in their heads.  They will tend to think in terms of arms which end in 5, instead of looking for other combinations that give a multiple of five.  Also, beginners do not think of reducing the previous total to a multiple of five. \nThe highest possible score in one play is 35 points, which is obtained by having the [6-6], [5-5] and [4-4] tiles on the ends of three arms of the layout and a tile which shows a 5 on the fourth arm.\nWhen you have the lead, play a tile worth ten points ([5-5] or [4-6]) if possible to score early.  Otherwise, play a double that gives you control the arms of the tableau.\nWhen another player draws a tile, you have information as to what was missing in his hand.  If he draws one tile and plays it, you know that if you can force the tableau to end in the values he was missing, you will force him to draw more tiles.\nThe smaller the total you leave to the next player, the smaller the total he can make from it.  \nYou can play to score, to block or to domino.  In the scoring game, you attempt to get the largest score without regard to who dominoes.  The scoring game is the obvious strategy and it is probably what you will pursue at the start of the game when you do not know the distribution of the tiles.  \nIn the blocking game, you try to force a blocked game with the intent that you will get the lowest negative score.  The blocking game is an end game strategy which depends on counting suits to see that there are no tiles outstanding in the suits on the arms of the tableau.\nPlaying to domino is really a version of the blocking strategy, since you will have the lowest negative score, namely zero.  However, it also has the advantage of giving you the lead in the following hand.  That lead can be important if you are close to winning the game. \nRemember that being the one to domino is not always the same thing as getting the most points in a hand.  Look for a suit where you are heavy or have control of the remaining tiles and try to get that suit exposed on one or more of the arms of the tableau to guarantee you have a play on your next turn.\nOther All Fives web pages\nJames Yates\' Dominoes Strategy page is devoted to the rules and strategy of All Fives dominoes.\nHere is a link to the rules of Five-Up, compiled by Ken Tidwell, editor of the Game Cabinet.

The basic game will be described first, followed by some variations with extra opening conditions, winning conditions or wild cards. These can be combined in various ways - for example jacks or better and trips to win are often played with a bug or wild card. This page assumes some familiarity with the general rules and terminology of poker. See the poker rules page for an introduction to these, and the poker betting and poker hand ranking pages for further details.\nFive Card Draw Poker\nThis basic game, with no restrictions on the cards needed to open or win, is sometimes known as California Draw or Guts, though Guts is also the name of another poker-like game. Because of this freedom it offers considerable scope for bluffing, especially if played for high stakes.\nPlayers and Cards\nFive Card Draw is played with a standard 52-card pack, and there can be from two to six players - six probably make the best game. It is possible for seven or or even eight  people to play, but then there is the disadvantage that the cards may run out during the draw.\nAnte, Deal and First Betting Round\nBefore the deal each player puts an agreed ante into the pot. Usually the ante is the same amount as the minimum bet.\nAfter the shuffle and cut, the dealer deals the cards face down clockwise one at a time until each player has five cards. Players may look at their cards, and there is a betting round begun by the player to dealer\'s left. If everyone passes (checks) in this first betting round, the cards are thrown in, the turn to deal passes to the left, the pot remains and  everyone adds another ante to it.\nIn fixed or spread limit games, the number of raises after the initial opening bet is usually limited to four.\nThe Draw \nIf more than one player remains in the game after the first betting round, active players have one opportunity to improve their hands by discarding some cards and obtaining replacements. Beginning with the nearest active player to dealer\'s left, each active player announces the number of cards to be replaced, discards that number of cards face down, and is dealt an equal number of cards face down by the dealer. \nA player can discard from zero to three cards. The dealer should wait until the player has discarded the number of cards stated before starting to deal replacements. Discarding no cards at all and thus keeping one\'s original hand is known as standing pat. Naturally, it is in the players\' interest to wait for their turns and not give away information in advance about how many cards they intend to draw.\nIn a game with more than six players it is possible that the deck will run out of cards (since each player can consume up to 8 cards - a hand of 5 plus 3 more drawn). If the dealer finds that not enough cards remain then the discards of the players who have already discarded are shuffled and cut to form a new deck from which replacement cards can be dealt to the remaining player(s). Reusing cards rejected by other players is not very satisfactory, and this is why six players is normally set as the maximum number for this game.\nUntil the second round of betting begins, any player is entitled to ask how many cards any other player drew, and be given an honest answer.\nSecond Betting Round\nAfter all active players have had a chance to draw there is a second round of betting, begun by the player who opened the betting on the first round. \nThe minimum and maximum bets allowed in the second betting round are normally set higher than in the first betting round - typically double.\nIn a fixed limit or spread limit game, the second betting round, like the first, is normally limited to a bet and four raises.\nShowdown\nAfter the second betting round, if the pot has not already been won, players show their cards in clockwise order, beginning with the last player who took aggressive action (bet or raised) in the second betting round. If everyone checked in the second betting round, the player who opened the betting in the first betting round shows first.\nVariations\nDrawing more than three cards\nSome allow a player to discard and draw four cards if the fifth card is an ace. Some allow a player to discard four or all five cards unconditionally. With these rules the likelihood of running out of cards during the draw process is increased. In practice, however, the difference is small since it is rarely if ever worthwhile to draw more than three cards.\nBlinds\nSome prefer to begin the pot with a blind bet instead of or in addition to the ante. In the first betting round, the player to dealer\'s left is forced to bet an agreed amount, irrespective of his cards. The next player to the left may be permitted to straddle by placing a blind bet of twice this amount, the next player to re-straddle and so on. Then the betting round begins with the player to the left of the player who placed the largest blind bet. Players may fold, call or raise. If all others call or fold, the player who placed the largest blind bet may check or raise. See the poker betting page for further details.\nFive Card Draw - Jacks or Better\nThis game, also known as Jack Pots, a hand at least as good as a pair of jacks is required to open the betting. It is probably the most popular version of Five Card Draw Poker. There should be at least four players and preferably more, otherwise most of the hands will be thrown in without play. Opinions on the merits of this game have varied widely over the years. For example:\n"The addition of jack pots has probably done more to injure Poker than the trump signal has injured Whist ... the whole system has become a nuisance, and has destroyed one of the finest points in the game of Poker - the liberty of personal judgement as to every counter put into the pool, except the blind." (R.F.Foster: Handbook to the Card Games, 1897).\n"It is essential for the stability of the game that a player have jacks or better when opening. If this rule is not enforced and a player opens the pot any time he feels like it, one of the greatest factors of skill in the game is automatically eliminated - which depends on knowing that the opener holds at least a pair of jacks." (J.Scarne: Scarne on Cards, 1949).\nThe ante and deal are as in Five Card Draw, but in the first betting round, if no one has yet bet, a player who does not have a pair of jacks or better is obliged to pass. Once a player has opened the betting, others are free to call or raise irrespective of what they hold.\nNote that the opener does not actually have to hold jacks, or cards higher than jacks. Any hand that beats a pair of tens is sufficient - for example you could open with 5-5-3-3-6 (two pairs) but not with 10-10-A-K-Q.\nThe draw is the same as in Five Card Draw, except that if the player who opened the betting discards cards that formed part of the qualification to open, this must be announced and the discarded cards kept separate from the cards discarded by other players. This is known as splitting openers. For example a player might discard the Q from Q-Q-10-7-6 in the hope of getting a flush, especially if some of the other players seemed to have good hands.\nThe second round of betting and the showdown are as in Five Card Draw. When the pot is awarded, the player who split openers must show the discarded card(s) to prove that the opening requirement was satisfied.\nIf no one has a good enough hand to open (or if those that do choose not to open), then the cards are thrown in and it is the next player\'s turn to deal. \nIf the opener wins the pot, enough of the opener\'s hand must be shown to prove that the opener really has jacks or better. This applies even if all the other players fold on the opener\'s bet. If the opener cannot show a qualifying hand, the opener\'s hand is dead. The opener cannot win the pot. If there was a showdown, the best of the other hands wins the pot. If everyone else has folded the pool remains for the next deal.\nSome play progressive jackpots: if no one opens  the minimum requirement for the next deal is increased to a pair of queens, and if this hand too is thrown in then kings and then aces, then back to kings, queens, jacks and so on.\nFive Card Draw - Jacks or Better, Trips to Win\nThe rules are the same as Five Card Draw - Jacks or Better except that a player needs a hand at least as good as three of a kind to win the pot. If the pot is won  without a showdown, the winner must expose enough cards to prove that the hand is at least as good as three of a kind. This of course further reduces the scope for bluffing.\nIf no one has a hand as good as three of a kind after the draw, the pot remains, but the players who folded before the draw are out of the game. The players who did not fold ante again and there is a new deal involving just these players.\nFive Card Draw with a Bug\nTo increase the proportion of good hands, some players add a joker, to make a deck of 53 cards. The joker is not a true wild card but a bug: the holder can use it to represent an ace, or to complete a straight or flush. So for example 9-9-7-7-joker is not a full house but two pairs with an ace kicker.\nIn this game the highest hand is five aces: A-A-A-A-joker. This beats a straight flush.\nWhen used in a flush the joker represents the highest card not already present, so for example A-K-J-4-2 beats A-10-9-8-joker because the bug represents the K not a second ace.\nThe bug can be added to any of the above versions: California (Guts) Draw, Jacks or Better or Trips to Win.\nFive Card Draw with Deuces Wild\nIn this variation of Jacks or Better, the four deuces (twos) are wild cards. A deuce can be used as any card the holder needs to complete a hand. The highest hand type is Five of a Kind, which is better than a Straight Flush.\nExcept when making Five of a Kind, a wild card cannot be used to represent a card that is already present in a player\'s hand. The only case where this matters is when making a Flush, in which case if you have (for example) a natural ace, you cannot use a wild card as a second ace.\nThis variant is found mostly in home poker games and is usually played with the rule that players must declare their own hands (the cards do not "speak for themselves" - see poker betting and showdown for details). \nIt is equally possible to play with any other set of cards wild as agreed by the players, or as specified by the dealer in a dealer\'s choice game. For example you one can play with fives wild, or with one-eyed jacks wild.\nWild Widow\nThis five-card draw variation is similar to deuces wild except that the wild card is determined during the deal rather than specified in advance. This is done by dealing a card dealt face up to the table, usually after the fourth card has been dealt to each player. The other three cards of the same rank as the face up card are wild. \nJacks Back    \nThis variation of Jacks or Better works well for smaller groups, say 3 to 5 players, in which case there will be many deals on which no one can open. \nThe game begins like Five Card Draw. Five cards are dealt to each player and there is a betting round, in which Jacks or Better are required to open. If someone opens the betting the game proceeds exactly like normal Five Card Draw, and in a showdown the highest hand wins the pot.\nIf no one opens in the first betting round the cards are not thrown in. Instead the players keep their cards and the game changes to Ace-to-five Lowball, and there is a new betting round begun by the player to dealer\'s left. Provided that the betting is opened in this new betting round, the players then have the chance to draw with the aim of making a low hand. After the draw there is another betting round, begun by the first active player to dealer\'s left. If more than one player stays in there is a showdown in which the lowest poker hand wins. Aces are low and straights and flushes do not count, so the best hand is A-2-3-4-5 (a "bicycle"). A-A-2-3-4 is a pair, so it is worse than any hand without a pair, but better than any other pair since aces are low. \nIt may happen that no one opens in the first betting round, and then after the game changes to Lowball everyone checks again. In this case the cards are thrown in and the turn to deal passes to the left.\nTo avoid the possibility that a hand is thrown in, some clubs have a rule that when the game changes to Lowball   the player to dealer\'s left must place a "blind" bet, and the betting round begins with the next player to the left. The player who placed the blind may raise after everyone else has acted even if no one did more than call. The betting round after the draw is begun by the first active player to dealer\'s left as usual.\nSome play that check-raising is not allowed in the Lowball part of this game, and also apply the betting sevens rule as for California Lowball.\nJacks Back is often played with a joker, which acts as a bug for high hands. When the game is played for low, the joker is known as a fitter, and it represents the lowest card not already present in the player\'s hand. Other forms of Lowball Draw Poker are described on the Lowball page.\nAll for One and One for All\nIn this game the drawing and betting can continue until the deck is all but exhausted.\nAntes are placed and five cards are dealt face down to each player. There is a betting round.\nNow there is a drawing round. Each active player, beginning to dealer\'s left, can either:\n\nstand pat, or\ndiscard one card face down and receive a replacement, or\ndiscard all five cards face down and receive a new five-card hand.\n\nThe drawing round is followed by another betting round.\nThis  process is repeated: there is a series of drawing rounds, each  begun by the player to the left of the one who began the previous drawing round. Each drawing round is followed by a betting round.\nThere are restrictions to ensure that the cards do not run out:\n\nA player is not allowed to exchange all five cards if this would not leave enough cards for all remaining active players in the current drawing round to exchange one.\nIf after a betting round there are fewer cards remaining in the deck than there are active players, there is no more drawing, but a showdown in which the highest hand wins the pot.  \n\n32-Card Poker\nSometimes known as Stripped Deck Poker, this version of Five Card Draw is popular in Southern Europe. The 32-card deck consists of cards from Ace (high) to Seven (low) in each suit. The main differences from normal Five Card Draw are as follows:\n\nBecause a flush is harder to make than with a 52-card pack, it ranks above a full house and below four of a kind.\nWhen used as a low card, Ace is adjacent to Seven, so A-7-8-9-10 is a low straight (or straight flush).\nThere is a ranking of suits, usually hearts (highest), diamonds, clubs, spades (lowest). When hands are otherwise equal, the suit of the highest card in the combination is compared. For example when two players have equal pairs with equal kickers, the pair containing the heart will win (the suits of the kickers don\'t count).\nThe maximum number of players is five: usually there are four players or fewer.\n\nVariants\nThe four-player versions of Italian Poker and Turkish Poker are forms of 32-card poker with some special rules.\nThe following variant is found in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and perhaps other places. A player who asks to exchange four cards discards four and is first dealt three cards face down to look at. Then the dealer deals  one card face up and one face down, and the player must choose which of these to take as the fourth card. If the face up card is chosen the face down card is discarded unseen.\nSeven Card Draw Poker\nThis variant is not widespread but it is played to a minor extent in the Netherlands. It is seen as a novelty game with a greater element of risk than 5 card draw, in that players have a better chance to make a high ranking combination. Because of the larger number of cards dealt, this game does not work well with more than four players.\nBefore the deal, the player to dealer\'s left places a small blind, and the next player to the left a big blind. The size of the blinds is agreed in advance - the small blind should be half the value of the big blind. The dealer then deals seven cards to each player and there is a first round of betting beginning to the left of the big blind.\nAfter the betting round each surviving player in turn, beginning to the left of the player who placed the big blind, has one opportunity to discard from zero to four cards and obtain replacements from the dealer. If the deck runs out during this process, the cards already discarded are shuffled to  a make new deck from which replacement cards can be dealt to the remaining player(s). \nAfter everyone has had a chance to exchange there is a second betting round beginning with the player to dealer\'s left. As usual, it is possible just to check, but if anyone wishes to bet, the minimum is twice the amount of the final bet in the first betting round (twice the big blind if no one raised in the first round).\nIn the showdown, each surviving player discards two cards and keeps five. The best five-card poker hand wins the pot.\nVariant: this game is often played with an ante placed by all players, in addition to the small and large blinds.\nRules of Seven Card Draw Poker in Dutch are available on the Pokeren Online site.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Draw Poker\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod  2010 - 2015.

It was taken to the USA, where it became very popular in the 19th century and gave rise to numerous other games. Meanwhile All Fours itself has become the national game of Trinidad, where it is sometimes known as All Foes, and it continues to be played in England, in Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nAll Fours in Trinidad\nWith thanks to Glen Benjamin for explaining the modern Trinidad game to me.\nPlayers, cards and objective\nNormally there are four players, in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other. It is also possible, but less usual, for two people to play. \nA standard 52 card pack is used. In each suit, the cards rank from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nThe object of the game is to score points by winning tricks with valuable cards in them. The player or team that takes more valuable cards in tricks will score one point for "game". In addition, there are points for taking the jack of trumps in a trick, and for the holders of the highest and lowest trumps dealt. It is also possible for the dealer\'s team to score points for the card turned up for trumps during the deal.\nDeal\nPlayers cut for the deal, and whoever cuts the highest card becomes the first dealer. Deal and play are anticlockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the right after each hand. Each player is dealt six cards. The dealer can choose whether to deal the cards one at a time or in batches of three, but having chosen must stick to the same method for the whole game.\nWhen everyone has six cards, the dealer turns the next card face up to indicate the trump suit. If this turned up card is an ace, six or jack, the dealer\'s team immediately scores for it as follows:\n\nAce turned up . . . 1 point\nSix turned up . . . 2 points\nJack turned up . . . 3 points\n\nIf the player on the dealer\'s right is happy with the trump suit that is shown by the turn up, he says "Stand" and play begins. If the player on the dealer\'s right would prefer a different trump suit, he says, "I beg". The dealer then has the option to change trumps or to keep the suit of the turned up card as trumps. \nIf the dealer decides to keep the trumps as turned up, he says, "Take one"; the opponents of the dealer receive one point and play begins. \nIf the dealer agrees to change the trump suit, he sets aside the turned up card, deals three more cards to each player, and then turns up the next card to determine the trump suit, scoring for it as above if it is an ace, jack or six. \n\nIf this new turn up is of a different suit than the first turn up, play begins with this new suit as trumps. \nIf the new turn up is the same suit as before, the dealer gives another three cards to each player and turns up another card, scoring again if it is an ace, jack or six. This procedure is repeated until the turn up produces a new trump suit. \nIf the deck is exhausted before a new trump suit is found, the entire deck is reshuffled and redealt. The dealer\'s team nevertheless keeps any points they have scored for turned up cards.\n\nPlay\nThe player on the dealer\'s right has the first lead, and the winner of the trick leads to the next trick. Any card can be led, but the other players are subject to the following rules:\n\nIf a trump is led, the other players must play a trump if they can; anyone who has no trumps left can play any card.\nIf a card of a non-trump suit is led, then any player who has a card of that suit must either follow suit, by playing a card of the suit led, or play a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led can play any card (there is no obligation to play a trump in this case).\n\nThe trick is won by the highest trump card played to it; if no trumps are played it is won by the highest card of the suit led. \n\nNote that the effect of these rules is that is is always legal to play a trump. The only play that is prohibited is to throw a non-trump card of a different suit from the lead when you could have followed suit. That would be a revoke or renege, and is penalised as explained below.\nPlay continues until all players have played all their cards. If the original trump suit was accepted there will be six tricks, but if a change of trump suit was begged for and allowed, the players will have larger hands and there will be 9 or 12 tricks, or possibly even more in a two-player game.\nScoring\nAt the end of the play, points are scored for the cards that were dealt or taken in tricks. The points are as follows:\n\nHigh1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who had the highest trump.\nLow1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who held the lowest trump that was dealt. It does not matter who wins the trick containing this trump - the point is for the original holders.\nJack1 or 3 pointsIf the jack of trumps wins a trick, or is won in a trick by the partner of the holder, the team with the jacks scores 1 point. If the jack is captured in a trick won by the opponents of the holder, the team capturing the jack scores 3 points for hang jack. If the jack of trumps was not dealt, then of course neither team scores for it.\nGame1 pointThis point goes to the team that wins the more valuable cards in tricks. For this purpose only, the top five cards in each suit have the following values: ace = 4, king = 3, queen = 2, jack = 1, ten = 10; other cards (2-9) have no value. Each team adds up the total value of the cards in their tricks, and whichever team has more scores the game point. If both teams have the same value of cards, no one gets the game point.\n\nEach team keeps a cumulative total of points they have won, and the first team to reach a total of 14 or more points over however many hands it takes wins the overall game. When nearing the end of a game, the points are counted strictly in the order high, low, jack, game to determine who has reached 14 first, so a tie is impossible. For example, suppose that at the start of a hand both teams have 13 points, that no points are scored for the turned up trump, and the trump suit is accepted. If team A has the highest trump, but team B win low, jack and game, then team A will win, because their point for high takes them to 14 before the other team can score.\nIrregularities\n\nMisdeal\nIf the dealer gives the wrong number of cards to the players, the opponents score one point for a misdeal, and the cards must be thrown in and shuffled and dealt again.\nRevoking - also called Reneging\nThis is playing a card of a non-trump card of a different suit from the card that was led when you could have followed suit. There is no penalty provided that the error is corrected by the player of the incorrect card before the end of the trick. An opposing player who notices the error may call the revoke at any time up to the end of the hand, and in that case the penalty is as follows. \n\nIf the player failed to follow a trump lead with trumps when they held one or more of the top five trumps, that player\'s team loses the whole of the game (14 points) currently in progress and a new game is started. \nIn other cases - a revoke on a non-trump lead or a failure to play a small trump on a trump lead - the opponents of the revoking player are awarded one point as a penalty, and the revoking team cannot win the point for game.\n\nCalling\nIf a player exposes a card other than in normal play, it must be left face up on the table. The opponents can then "call" for this card to be played on any subsequent trick, provided that playing it will not cause a revoke. \n\nVariations\nIn Tobago, it is the two rather than the six which scores two points when turned up.\nSome play that a player who has no trumps is forced to beg.\nSome play that "undertrumping" is not allowed. That is: if a non-trump suit is led and trumped, a later player is not allowed to play a lower trump unless he has no option.\nOther Trinidad All Fours web pages\nAs you might expect, Trinidad All Fours is also played in other places where there are people with a Trinidadian cultural background. For example, here is the web site of the Manitoba All Fours Association, in Canada.\nTrinidad All Fours software and on line games\nYou can obtain a Trinidad All Fours program at All Fours Online, which can be used to play against the computer or against an opponent on line. An online mobile phone version is also available.\nYou can play four-player Trinidad All Fours on line against live opponents at www.ttafo.com.\nWest Yorkshire All Fours\nAll Fours remains popular in parts of northern England. It is played in West Yorkshire pubs informally and on a league basis. Also Arthur Taylor, in his book of Pub Games reports a slightly different version played around Blackburn, Lancashire. I will describe the West Yorkshire version first, based on games played in 2003 in the Black Labrador pub, Batley, which belongs to the Heckmondwike league. I would like to thank the landlord John Dunning and his wife Anita for their help and hospitality.\nThere are four players in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. A standard 52 card pack is used, with the ace high and two low as usual. To begin the game, any player shuffles the cards, offers them to be cut by the player to the right, and deals the cards one at a time face up clockwise beginning with the player to their left until a jack appears.  The player who received the jack will pitch first, and the player to the right of the pitcher will deal the first hand.\nDeal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.  The dealer shuffles all the cards, and must offer them to the opponent to the right to cut.  The opponent may cut the cards or leave them as they are. The dealer deals six cards to each player, clockwise, in three rounds.  The number of cards dealt to each player in each round is at the choice of the dealer, for example all the cards may be dealt two at a time, or the dealer could deal one round three cards at a time, then one round two cards at a time and finish with a round of single cards.\nNo card is turned up for trumps. Instead, the pitcher (the player to dealer\'s left) leads (or "pitches") any card and the suit of that card is trumps for the hand. The pitcher\'s partner must not look at his or her cards until after the pitcher has led. This is to avoid any suspicion that the pitcher\'s partner might signal to the pitcher what suit to lead. (The penalty if the pitcher\'s partner breaks this rule is 4 points to the other team.)\nThe rules of play are the same as in Trinidad. A player who has a card of the suit led must either follow suit or trump. A player with no card of the suit led can play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump, or if it contains none, by the highest card of the suit led, and the winner leads to the next trick.\nThe first trick is stacked face up in front of one member of the team that won it, with a trump on top, to indicate the trump suit. Subsequent tricks are stored face down in front of one member of the winning team, in the usual way.\nIf you have no trumps and no valuable cards left (nothing higher than a nine), and you are not winning the current trick, you are allowed to indicate to your partner that your remaining cards are useless by throwing in your hand.  This is normally done by playing all your cards together, face up to the current trick.  You then take no further part in the play, and your partner continues alone.\nWhen the six tricks have been played, points are awarded in order as follows.\n\nHigh: the team that has the highest trump pegs one point.\nLow: the team that was dealt the lowest trump scores one point.\nJack: the team that wins the trick containing the jack of trumps scores one point. If the Jack was not dealt, this point is not awarded.\nGame: the team whose tricks have the highest total value of cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 in all four suits as usual, score one point. In the unusual case where both teams have exactly the same total value of cards in their tricks, neither team scores the point for game.\n\n\n\nThe points are pegged on a special wooden peg board, and the first team to reach 11 points wins. In the event that both teams are close to winning, the points are always pegged in the order high, low, jack, game.  So, for example, if the score is 10-10 the team holding the highest trump will win the match, even if the other team would have won the other three points.\nWhen playing for money, it is usual to agree a stake for winning the match, and an additional stake for winning all four points in one hand.  For example, if playing 2 pounds and 1 pound, if team A scores all four twice and wins the match, while team B scores all four once, each member of team A would receive 3 pounds (2+1+1-1) and each member of team B would pay 3 pounds.\nWhen there is a payment for \'all four\', the play of the last hand of a match must be continued as long as there is a chance of \'all four\' being made, even if the result of the match is already settled.  (For example, a team with 10 points pitches the ace of trumps, winning the match, but can continue playing to try to make all four on the hand, but if an opponent has the trump 2, play can end, since there is nothing more at stake.)\nTactics\nThe choice of pitch is of great importance.  Since this first card fixes the trump suit, it determines who will win two of the four possible points: high and low.  A short suit containing the ace is preferable to a longer suit of intermediate cards; a suit containing the ace and two, for two sure points, is ideal.  The jack may yield a point if protected by other cards in the same suit, but it would be better to pitch a bare ace or even a two for a sure point than (say) the eight from J-8 for a possible point if your jack is not caught.  However, a jack in a three-card suit can usually be saved, so for example J-9-2 would be a better suit to pitch from than A-6.  Lacking aces, it may be worth choosing a suit headed by a king or even a queen.  Since only 24 of the 52 cards are dealt out, your king or queen could score the high point if no one has the top card(s) of the suit.\nIn the play, do not be too concerned with winning tricks, unless they are of some value.  Rather than win a cheap trick it is often better to leave an opponent \'in\' (i.e. with the lead), so that your side will play last to the next trick.\nThe most important objective of the play is to catch or save the jack of trumps, if it has been dealt.  If you have one of the top three trumps, and suspect the opponents may have the jack, it is worth saving your top card until you can catch the jack.\nAs far as the game point is concerned, the most important cards are the tens, which account for half the value of the pack, but are difficult to save since they are only the fifth highest cards of their suits.  If your partner is winning a trick in a suit which you are \'off\' (have no cards in), don\'t neglect to throw a ten of another suit into the trick if you have one.  When playing second to a trick, it is sometimes worth playing a ten in the hope that partner can win the trick.  Sometimes a player will \'push\' with a ten - offer it in the hope that the opponents will use a high trump to capture it.  A simple example would be to trump with the 10 holding J-10 in the hope that an opponent with a top trump would use it to catch the 10 and let you save your jack.\nAs in any game it is important to pay attention to the fall of the cards.  You cannot accurately count the suits, since over half the cards are undealt, but there are many inferences from the cards that are played or not played.  To begin with, anyone who does not play a trump to the first trick is off trumps, so their right-hand opponent can win tricks efficiently with small trumps or top cards of other suits.  Ideally you should be aware when players are off other suits, and also when any of your cards becomes a \'bobby\' - the highest outstanding card of its suit.\nTactics are affected to some extent by the score in the match.  If you are a long way behind it is worth taking risks to catch up; if you are ahead you should play safe.\nVariations\nWhen partnerships are not arranged in advance, at the start of the game cards are dealt around face up until all four jacks have appeared (a player who has received a jack is dealt no more cards). The people with the two red jacks are partners against those with the black jacks. The same procedure can be used when there are more than four people wishing to play. The four who received the jacks play and the others wait for a future opportunity to join in.\nSome cut to decide first pitch - highest card pitches first.\nIn some places \'trumping in\' is not allowed.  In these places you are only allowed to play a trump if a trump is led, or if you are unable to follow suit to a non-trump lead. One correspondent told me that the (original) version of the rules, in which a trump can be played at any time, is known as \'Batley Carr Rules\' or \'Scarborough Rules\'. Another tells me that trumping in is allowed in Holmfirth, but 3 miles away in Honley it is not.\nIt is possible for six people to play, in three teams of two, or two people to play against each other. The rules of play and scoring are exactly the same is for four players; the two-player game is played to 9 points and the six-player game to 11 points.\nIn the Heckmondwike league, when two pubs compete, each pub fields eight players, and they play four simultaneous matches to 15 points.  The winners of each score two match points and another two match points are scored by the pub with the higher total game point score over the four tables.  There is no bonus for "all four" in the league version.\nLancashire All Fours\nAccording to Arthur Taylor\'s book of Pub Games (St Albans, 1976; Guinness, 1992), All Fours is played in Blackburn in casual games and in several leagues. Rules are similar to the Yorkshire version described above, with a few differences.\n\nTo begin the game the cards are cut for first pitch. A player of one team cuts and a player of the other team must guess whether the cut card is red or black: if the guesser is right, the guesser\'s team selects a player to pitch first; if not, a player of the cutting team pitches first.The point for Low goes to the team that wins the trick containing the lowest trump dealt, not the original holder of the card, as in other versions.\nArthur Taylor does not mention that the first trick is stored face up, nor that a player without trumps or counting cards can throw their hand in. The natural assumption would therefore be that all tricks are stored face down, and that all players keep playing to the last trick, even if they have no useful cards left.\n\n17th Century English All-Fours\nThe earliest description of All Fours that I know of was published in Charles Cotton\'s "Compleat Gamester" (1674). According to this account, the game was much played in Kent, and originated in that county. It was a game for two players, using the 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen by cutting cards - whoever cuts the highest "Put-card" deals. [This apparently means that when cutting for deal, the cards rank from high to low 3-2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4 as in the contemporary game of Put. For all other purposes, however, the cards rank A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2 as usual. It is not mentioned, but presumably the dealer shuffles and the dealer\'s opponent cuts before the deal. Presumably the turn to deal alternates between the players.]\nThe dealer deals six cards to each player in batches of three and turns up the next card, the 13th, to show the proposed trump suit, scoring one point if it is a jack. The dealer\'s opponent can either accept the trump suit or beg one. If the non-dealer begs, the dealer must either allow the non-dealer to score one point and throw in the cards, or deal another three cards each and turn another card for trumps, repeating this until a different suit is turned. [It is unclear how the point for a turned up jack is treated if the trump suit is changed. It could either be like the modern Trinidad game, in which all turned jacks are scored, or like the 19th century American game, in which only the jack of the final trump suit can be scored.]\nThe non-dealer leads to the first trick and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The higher trump wins, or if no trump is played, the higher card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nWhen all the cards have been played, points are scored in order as follows:\n\nHighest: one point for the holder of the highest trump dealt.\nLowest: one point for the original holder of the lowest trump dealt.\nJack: one point for a player who wins a trick containing the jack of trumps.\nGame: one point for the player whose tricks contain the higher value in cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 as usual.\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the agreed target score, which can be from 7 to 15, but is most commonly set at 11.\n\nA variation called Running All-Fours is briefly described. This is played to a target score of 31 points, and the only other difference is that in the deal, the dealer scores 4 points if the turned up trump is an ace, 3 is it is a king, 2 if it is a queen or 1 if it is a jack.\nNorth American All Fours, Old Sledge or Seven Up\nTo judge from the literature, All Fours became very popular in North America in the 19th century. In the 20th century it was largely superseded by bidding variations such as Pitch and Pedro.\nIn American card game books of the early 19th century, All Fours is a two-player game, very similar to the 17th century English game described above. When cutting for deal the cards now rank in their normal order with ace high, and the deal can be one or three cards at a time at the dealer\'s choice. Many play that if the non-dealer begs and the dealer decides to change the trump suit, then after the necessary extra cards have been dealt, the players discard unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. The target score is 10 points.\nThe version of All Fours described by R.F.Foster in 1897 goes by the name of Old Sledge or Seven Up. It can be played by two or three players, each playing for themselves, or by four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The deal and play are clockwise and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The dealer deals six cards to each player, three at a time, and then turns up a card to show the proposed trump suit.\nThe player to dealer\'s left may beg, and dealer has the usual options.\n\nSay "Take it", and play with the proposed trump suit, allowing the opponent(s) to score one point for gift.  If there are three players, both opponents score, but if the opponent who did not beg needs only one point for game, he is not allowed to win in this way, so presumably the dealer is forced to run the cards in that case.\nChange the trump suit by running the cards. The dealer deals three more cards to each player and turns up another card; if it is the same suit as the first one, he repeats this until a new suit is turned up for trumps. If the deck is exhausted, the cards are bunched - the cards are thrown in, shuffled and redealt by the same dealer.\n\nAfter the cards have been run, any player who does not like the second trump suit can propose to bunch the cards. If all players agree there is a redeal by the same dealer, but anyone can insist on playing with the new trumps and no points are given for this.\n\nIf a jack is turned up for trump, the dealer (or dealer\'s team) scores one point for it, but if the cards are run, no point is scored for a jack turned up in the original turned suit, and no point is scored if the cards are bunched. The point is only scored if the turned up card that finally determines trumps is a jack.\nAfter the cards have been run and a new trump suit determined, all players discard face-down sufficient unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. In some circles this was only done if the players had 12 or more cards, but if the cards were run only once, the players kept and played with their 9-card hands.\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The highest trump wins, or if no trump is played, the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nThere are the usual four points: High, Low, Jack and Game, scored in that order, with the Low point going to the original holder of the card, not the player who wins it in a trick. In the event of a tie for Game in the two- or four-player game, the point goes to the opponent(s) of the dealer. This is meant to compensate to some extent for the dealer\'s advantage in being able to score a point if a jack is turned for trumps. In a three-player game, if the two non-dealers tie for the Game point no one gets it, but if the dealer ties with another player, the other player gets it.\nThe game is usually played to seven points. Each player or team starts with seven chips, and places one in the pool for each point they win; the winner is the first player or team to have placed all their chips in the pool.\nFoster describes a variation called Blind All Fours or Pitch in which no card is turned for trumps and there is no begging or running of the cards. In this game the first card pitched by the player to dealer\'s left fixes the trump suit (as in Lancashire All Fours). In this game, when the Game point is tied no one gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > All Fours Group > All Fours\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2003, 2007.

It was taken to the USA, where it became very popular in the 19th century and gave rise to numerous other games. Meanwhile All Fours itself has become the national game of Trinidad, where it is sometimes known as All Foes, and it continues to be played in England, in Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nAll Fours in Trinidad\nWith thanks to Glen Benjamin for explaining the modern Trinidad game to me.\nPlayers, cards and objective\nNormally there are four players, in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other. It is also possible, but less usual, for two people to play. \nA standard 52 card pack is used. In each suit, the cards rank from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nThe object of the game is to score points by winning tricks with valuable cards in them. The player or team that takes more valuable cards in tricks will score one point for "game". In addition, there are points for taking the jack of trumps in a trick, and for the holders of the highest and lowest trumps dealt. It is also possible for the dealer\'s team to score points for the card turned up for trumps during the deal.\nDeal\nPlayers cut for the deal, and whoever cuts the highest card becomes the first dealer. Deal and play are anticlockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the right after each hand. Each player is dealt six cards. The dealer can choose whether to deal the cards one at a time or in batches of three, but having chosen must stick to the same method for the whole game.\nWhen everyone has six cards, the dealer turns the next card face up to indicate the trump suit. If this turned up card is an ace, six or jack, the dealer\'s team immediately scores for it as follows:\n\nAce turned up . . . 1 point\nSix turned up . . . 2 points\nJack turned up . . . 3 points\n\nIf the player on the dealer\'s right is happy with the trump suit that is shown by the turn up, he says "Stand" and play begins. If the player on the dealer\'s right would prefer a different trump suit, he says, "I beg". The dealer then has the option to change trumps or to keep the suit of the turned up card as trumps. \nIf the dealer decides to keep the trumps as turned up, he says, "Take one"; the opponents of the dealer receive one point and play begins. \nIf the dealer agrees to change the trump suit, he sets aside the turned up card, deals three more cards to each player, and then turns up the next card to determine the trump suit, scoring for it as above if it is an ace, jack or six. \n\nIf this new turn up is of a different suit than the first turn up, play begins with this new suit as trumps. \nIf the new turn up is the same suit as before, the dealer gives another three cards to each player and turns up another card, scoring again if it is an ace, jack or six. This procedure is repeated until the turn up produces a new trump suit. \nIf the deck is exhausted before a new trump suit is found, the entire deck is reshuffled and redealt. The dealer\'s team nevertheless keeps any points they have scored for turned up cards.\n\nPlay\nThe player on the dealer\'s right has the first lead, and the winner of the trick leads to the next trick. Any card can be led, but the other players are subject to the following rules:\n\nIf a trump is led, the other players must play a trump if they can; anyone who has no trumps left can play any card.\nIf a card of a non-trump suit is led, then any player who has a card of that suit must either follow suit, by playing a card of the suit led, or play a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led can play any card (there is no obligation to play a trump in this case).\n\nThe trick is won by the highest trump card played to it; if no trumps are played it is won by the highest card of the suit led. \n\nNote that the effect of these rules is that is is always legal to play a trump. The only play that is prohibited is to throw a non-trump card of a different suit from the lead when you could have followed suit. That would be a revoke or renege, and is penalised as explained below.\nPlay continues until all players have played all their cards. If the original trump suit was accepted there will be six tricks, but if a change of trump suit was begged for and allowed, the players will have larger hands and there will be 9 or 12 tricks, or possibly even more in a two-player game.\nScoring\nAt the end of the play, points are scored for the cards that were dealt or taken in tricks. The points are as follows:\n\nHigh1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who had the highest trump.\nLow1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who held the lowest trump that was dealt. It does not matter who wins the trick containing this trump - the point is for the original holders.\nJack1 or 3 pointsIf the jack of trumps wins a trick, or is won in a trick by the partner of the holder, the team with the jacks scores 1 point. If the jack is captured in a trick won by the opponents of the holder, the team capturing the jack scores 3 points for hang jack. If the jack of trumps was not dealt, then of course neither team scores for it.\nGame1 pointThis point goes to the team that wins the more valuable cards in tricks. For this purpose only, the top five cards in each suit have the following values: ace = 4, king = 3, queen = 2, jack = 1, ten = 10; other cards (2-9) have no value. Each team adds up the total value of the cards in their tricks, and whichever team has more scores the game point. If both teams have the same value of cards, no one gets the game point.\n\nEach team keeps a cumulative total of points they have won, and the first team to reach a total of 14 or more points over however many hands it takes wins the overall game. When nearing the end of a game, the points are counted strictly in the order high, low, jack, game to determine who has reached 14 first, so a tie is impossible. For example, suppose that at the start of a hand both teams have 13 points, that no points are scored for the turned up trump, and the trump suit is accepted. If team A has the highest trump, but team B win low, jack and game, then team A will win, because their point for high takes them to 14 before the other team can score.\nIrregularities\n\nMisdeal\nIf the dealer gives the wrong number of cards to the players, the opponents score one point for a misdeal, and the cards must be thrown in and shuffled and dealt again.\nRevoking - also called Reneging\nThis is playing a card of a non-trump card of a different suit from the card that was led when you could have followed suit. There is no penalty provided that the error is corrected by the player of the incorrect card before the end of the trick. An opposing player who notices the error may call the revoke at any time up to the end of the hand, and in that case the penalty is as follows. \n\nIf the player failed to follow a trump lead with trumps when they held one or more of the top five trumps, that player\'s team loses the whole of the game (14 points) currently in progress and a new game is started. \nIn other cases - a revoke on a non-trump lead or a failure to play a small trump on a trump lead - the opponents of the revoking player are awarded one point as a penalty, and the revoking team cannot win the point for game.\n\nCalling\nIf a player exposes a card other than in normal play, it must be left face up on the table. The opponents can then "call" for this card to be played on any subsequent trick, provided that playing it will not cause a revoke. \n\nVariations\nIn Tobago, it is the two rather than the six which scores two points when turned up.\nSome play that a player who has no trumps is forced to beg.\nSome play that "undertrumping" is not allowed. That is: if a non-trump suit is led and trumped, a later player is not allowed to play a lower trump unless he has no option.\nOther Trinidad All Fours web pages\nAs you might expect, Trinidad All Fours is also played in other places where there are people with a Trinidadian cultural background. For example, here is the web site of the Manitoba All Fours Association, in Canada.\nTrinidad All Fours software and on line games\nYou can obtain a Trinidad All Fours program at All Fours Online, which can be used to play against the computer or against an opponent on line. An online mobile phone version is also available.\nYou can play four-player Trinidad All Fours on line against live opponents at www.ttafo.com.\nWest Yorkshire All Fours\nAll Fours remains popular in parts of northern England. It is played in West Yorkshire pubs informally and on a league basis. Also Arthur Taylor, in his book of Pub Games reports a slightly different version played around Blackburn, Lancashire. I will describe the West Yorkshire version first, based on games played in 2003 in the Black Labrador pub, Batley, which belongs to the Heckmondwike league. I would like to thank the landlord John Dunning and his wife Anita for their help and hospitality.\nThere are four players in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. A standard 52 card pack is used, with the ace high and two low as usual. To begin the game, any player shuffles the cards, offers them to be cut by the player to the right, and deals the cards one at a time face up clockwise beginning with the player to their left until a jack appears.  The player who received the jack will pitch first, and the player to the right of the pitcher will deal the first hand.\nDeal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.  The dealer shuffles all the cards, and must offer them to the opponent to the right to cut.  The opponent may cut the cards or leave them as they are. The dealer deals six cards to each player, clockwise, in three rounds.  The number of cards dealt to each player in each round is at the choice of the dealer, for example all the cards may be dealt two at a time, or the dealer could deal one round three cards at a time, then one round two cards at a time and finish with a round of single cards.\nNo card is turned up for trumps. Instead, the pitcher (the player to dealer\'s left) leads (or "pitches") any card and the suit of that card is trumps for the hand. The pitcher\'s partner must not look at his or her cards until after the pitcher has led. This is to avoid any suspicion that the pitcher\'s partner might signal to the pitcher what suit to lead. (The penalty if the pitcher\'s partner breaks this rule is 4 points to the other team.)\nThe rules of play are the same as in Trinidad. A player who has a card of the suit led must either follow suit or trump. A player with no card of the suit led can play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump, or if it contains none, by the highest card of the suit led, and the winner leads to the next trick.\nThe first trick is stacked face up in front of one member of the team that won it, with a trump on top, to indicate the trump suit. Subsequent tricks are stored face down in front of one member of the winning team, in the usual way.\nIf you have no trumps and no valuable cards left (nothing higher than a nine), and you are not winning the current trick, you are allowed to indicate to your partner that your remaining cards are useless by throwing in your hand.  This is normally done by playing all your cards together, face up to the current trick.  You then take no further part in the play, and your partner continues alone.\nWhen the six tricks have been played, points are awarded in order as follows.\n\nHigh: the team that has the highest trump pegs one point.\nLow: the team that was dealt the lowest trump scores one point.\nJack: the team that wins the trick containing the jack of trumps scores one point. If the Jack was not dealt, this point is not awarded.\nGame: the team whose tricks have the highest total value of cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 in all four suits as usual, score one point. In the unusual case where both teams have exactly the same total value of cards in their tricks, neither team scores the point for game.\n\n\n\nThe points are pegged on a special wooden peg board, and the first team to reach 11 points wins. In the event that both teams are close to winning, the points are always pegged in the order high, low, jack, game.  So, for example, if the score is 10-10 the team holding the highest trump will win the match, even if the other team would have won the other three points.\nWhen playing for money, it is usual to agree a stake for winning the match, and an additional stake for winning all four points in one hand.  For example, if playing 2 pounds and 1 pound, if team A scores all four twice and wins the match, while team B scores all four once, each member of team A would receive 3 pounds (2+1+1-1) and each member of team B would pay 3 pounds.\nWhen there is a payment for \'all four\', the play of the last hand of a match must be continued as long as there is a chance of \'all four\' being made, even if the result of the match is already settled.  (For example, a team with 10 points pitches the ace of trumps, winning the match, but can continue playing to try to make all four on the hand, but if an opponent has the trump 2, play can end, since there is nothing more at stake.)\nTactics\nThe choice of pitch is of great importance.  Since this first card fixes the trump suit, it determines who will win two of the four possible points: high and low.  A short suit containing the ace is preferable to a longer suit of intermediate cards; a suit containing the ace and two, for two sure points, is ideal.  The jack may yield a point if protected by other cards in the same suit, but it would be better to pitch a bare ace or even a two for a sure point than (say) the eight from J-8 for a possible point if your jack is not caught.  However, a jack in a three-card suit can usually be saved, so for example J-9-2 would be a better suit to pitch from than A-6.  Lacking aces, it may be worth choosing a suit headed by a king or even a queen.  Since only 24 of the 52 cards are dealt out, your king or queen could score the high point if no one has the top card(s) of the suit.\nIn the play, do not be too concerned with winning tricks, unless they are of some value.  Rather than win a cheap trick it is often better to leave an opponent \'in\' (i.e. with the lead), so that your side will play last to the next trick.\nThe most important objective of the play is to catch or save the jack of trumps, if it has been dealt.  If you have one of the top three trumps, and suspect the opponents may have the jack, it is worth saving your top card until you can catch the jack.\nAs far as the game point is concerned, the most important cards are the tens, which account for half the value of the pack, but are difficult to save since they are only the fifth highest cards of their suits.  If your partner is winning a trick in a suit which you are \'off\' (have no cards in), don\'t neglect to throw a ten of another suit into the trick if you have one.  When playing second to a trick, it is sometimes worth playing a ten in the hope that partner can win the trick.  Sometimes a player will \'push\' with a ten - offer it in the hope that the opponents will use a high trump to capture it.  A simple example would be to trump with the 10 holding J-10 in the hope that an opponent with a top trump would use it to catch the 10 and let you save your jack.\nAs in any game it is important to pay attention to the fall of the cards.  You cannot accurately count the suits, since over half the cards are undealt, but there are many inferences from the cards that are played or not played.  To begin with, anyone who does not play a trump to the first trick is off trumps, so their right-hand opponent can win tricks efficiently with small trumps or top cards of other suits.  Ideally you should be aware when players are off other suits, and also when any of your cards becomes a \'bobby\' - the highest outstanding card of its suit.\nTactics are affected to some extent by the score in the match.  If you are a long way behind it is worth taking risks to catch up; if you are ahead you should play safe.\nVariations\nWhen partnerships are not arranged in advance, at the start of the game cards are dealt around face up until all four jacks have appeared (a player who has received a jack is dealt no more cards). The people with the two red jacks are partners against those with the black jacks. The same procedure can be used when there are more than four people wishing to play. The four who received the jacks play and the others wait for a future opportunity to join in.\nSome cut to decide first pitch - highest card pitches first.\nIn some places \'trumping in\' is not allowed.  In these places you are only allowed to play a trump if a trump is led, or if you are unable to follow suit to a non-trump lead. One correspondent told me that the (original) version of the rules, in which a trump can be played at any time, is known as \'Batley Carr Rules\' or \'Scarborough Rules\'. Another tells me that trumping in is allowed in Holmfirth, but 3 miles away in Honley it is not.\nIt is possible for six people to play, in three teams of two, or two people to play against each other. The rules of play and scoring are exactly the same is for four players; the two-player game is played to 9 points and the six-player game to 11 points.\nIn the Heckmondwike league, when two pubs compete, each pub fields eight players, and they play four simultaneous matches to 15 points.  The winners of each score two match points and another two match points are scored by the pub with the higher total game point score over the four tables.  There is no bonus for "all four" in the league version.\nLancashire All Fours\nAccording to Arthur Taylor\'s book of Pub Games (St Albans, 1976; Guinness, 1992), All Fours is played in Blackburn in casual games and in several leagues. Rules are similar to the Yorkshire version described above, with a few differences.\n\nTo begin the game the cards are cut for first pitch. A player of one team cuts and a player of the other team must guess whether the cut card is red or black: if the guesser is right, the guesser\'s team selects a player to pitch first; if not, a player of the cutting team pitches first.The point for Low goes to the team that wins the trick containing the lowest trump dealt, not the original holder of the card, as in other versions.\nArthur Taylor does not mention that the first trick is stored face up, nor that a player without trumps or counting cards can throw their hand in. The natural assumption would therefore be that all tricks are stored face down, and that all players keep playing to the last trick, even if they have no useful cards left.\n\n17th Century English All-Fours\nThe earliest description of All Fours that I know of was published in Charles Cotton\'s "Compleat Gamester" (1674). According to this account, the game was much played in Kent, and originated in that county. It was a game for two players, using the 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen by cutting cards - whoever cuts the highest "Put-card" deals. [This apparently means that when cutting for deal, the cards rank from high to low 3-2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4 as in the contemporary game of Put. For all other purposes, however, the cards rank A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2 as usual. It is not mentioned, but presumably the dealer shuffles and the dealer\'s opponent cuts before the deal. Presumably the turn to deal alternates between the players.]\nThe dealer deals six cards to each player in batches of three and turns up the next card, the 13th, to show the proposed trump suit, scoring one point if it is a jack. The dealer\'s opponent can either accept the trump suit or beg one. If the non-dealer begs, the dealer must either allow the non-dealer to score one point and throw in the cards, or deal another three cards each and turn another card for trumps, repeating this until a different suit is turned. [It is unclear how the point for a turned up jack is treated if the trump suit is changed. It could either be like the modern Trinidad game, in which all turned jacks are scored, or like the 19th century American game, in which only the jack of the final trump suit can be scored.]\nThe non-dealer leads to the first trick and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The higher trump wins, or if no trump is played, the higher card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nWhen all the cards have been played, points are scored in order as follows:\n\nHighest: one point for the holder of the highest trump dealt.\nLowest: one point for the original holder of the lowest trump dealt.\nJack: one point for a player who wins a trick containing the jack of trumps.\nGame: one point for the player whose tricks contain the higher value in cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 as usual.\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the agreed target score, which can be from 7 to 15, but is most commonly set at 11.\n\nA variation called Running All-Fours is briefly described. This is played to a target score of 31 points, and the only other difference is that in the deal, the dealer scores 4 points if the turned up trump is an ace, 3 is it is a king, 2 if it is a queen or 1 if it is a jack.\nNorth American All Fours, Old Sledge or Seven Up\nTo judge from the literature, All Fours became very popular in North America in the 19th century. In the 20th century it was largely superseded by bidding variations such as Pitch and Pedro.\nIn American card game books of the early 19th century, All Fours is a two-player game, very similar to the 17th century English game described above. When cutting for deal the cards now rank in their normal order with ace high, and the deal can be one or three cards at a time at the dealer\'s choice. Many play that if the non-dealer begs and the dealer decides to change the trump suit, then after the necessary extra cards have been dealt, the players discard unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. The target score is 10 points.\nThe version of All Fours described by R.F.Foster in 1897 goes by the name of Old Sledge or Seven Up. It can be played by two or three players, each playing for themselves, or by four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The deal and play are clockwise and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The dealer deals six cards to each player, three at a time, and then turns up a card to show the proposed trump suit.\nThe player to dealer\'s left may beg, and dealer has the usual options.\n\nSay "Take it", and play with the proposed trump suit, allowing the opponent(s) to score one point for gift.  If there are three players, both opponents score, but if the opponent who did not beg needs only one point for game, he is not allowed to win in this way, so presumably the dealer is forced to run the cards in that case.\nChange the trump suit by running the cards. The dealer deals three more cards to each player and turns up another card; if it is the same suit as the first one, he repeats this until a new suit is turned up for trumps. If the deck is exhausted, the cards are bunched - the cards are thrown in, shuffled and redealt by the same dealer.\n\nAfter the cards have been run, any player who does not like the second trump suit can propose to bunch the cards. If all players agree there is a redeal by the same dealer, but anyone can insist on playing with the new trumps and no points are given for this.\n\nIf a jack is turned up for trump, the dealer (or dealer\'s team) scores one point for it, but if the cards are run, no point is scored for a jack turned up in the original turned suit, and no point is scored if the cards are bunched. The point is only scored if the turned up card that finally determines trumps is a jack.\nAfter the cards have been run and a new trump suit determined, all players discard face-down sufficient unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. In some circles this was only done if the players had 12 or more cards, but if the cards were run only once, the players kept and played with their 9-card hands.\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The highest trump wins, or if no trump is played, the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nThere are the usual four points: High, Low, Jack and Game, scored in that order, with the Low point going to the original holder of the card, not the player who wins it in a trick. In the event of a tie for Game in the two- or four-player game, the point goes to the opponent(s) of the dealer. This is meant to compensate to some extent for the dealer\'s advantage in being able to score a point if a jack is turned for trumps. In a three-player game, if the two non-dealers tie for the Game point no one gets it, but if the dealer ties with another player, the other player gets it.\nThe game is usually played to seven points. Each player or team starts with seven chips, and places one in the pool for each point they win; the winner is the first player or team to have placed all their chips in the pool.\nFoster describes a variation called Blind All Fours or Pitch in which no card is turned for trumps and there is no begging or running of the cards. In this game the first card pitched by the player to dealer\'s left fixes the trump suit (as in Lancashire All Fours). In this game, when the Game point is tied no one gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > All Fours Group > All Fours\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2003, 2007.

It was taken to the USA, where it became very popular in the 19th century and gave rise to numerous other games. Meanwhile All Fours itself has become the national game of Trinidad, where it is sometimes known as All Foes, and it continues to be played in England, in Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nAll Fours in Trinidad\nWith thanks to Glen Benjamin for explaining the modern Trinidad game to me.\nPlayers, cards and objective\nNormally there are four players, in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other. It is also possible, but less usual, for two people to play. \nA standard 52 card pack is used. In each suit, the cards rank from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nThe object of the game is to score points by winning tricks with valuable cards in them. The player or team that takes more valuable cards in tricks will score one point for "game". In addition, there are points for taking the jack of trumps in a trick, and for the holders of the highest and lowest trumps dealt. It is also possible for the dealer\'s team to score points for the card turned up for trumps during the deal.\nDeal\nPlayers cut for the deal, and whoever cuts the highest card becomes the first dealer. Deal and play are anticlockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the right after each hand. Each player is dealt six cards. The dealer can choose whether to deal the cards one at a time or in batches of three, but having chosen must stick to the same method for the whole game.\nWhen everyone has six cards, the dealer turns the next card face up to indicate the trump suit. If this turned up card is an ace, six or jack, the dealer\'s team immediately scores for it as follows:\n\nAce turned up . . . 1 point\nSix turned up . . . 2 points\nJack turned up . . . 3 points\n\nIf the player on the dealer\'s right is happy with the trump suit that is shown by the turn up, he says "Stand" and play begins. If the player on the dealer\'s right would prefer a different trump suit, he says, "I beg". The dealer then has the option to change trumps or to keep the suit of the turned up card as trumps. \nIf the dealer decides to keep the trumps as turned up, he says, "Take one"; the opponents of the dealer receive one point and play begins. \nIf the dealer agrees to change the trump suit, he sets aside the turned up card, deals three more cards to each player, and then turns up the next card to determine the trump suit, scoring for it as above if it is an ace, jack or six. \n\nIf this new turn up is of a different suit than the first turn up, play begins with this new suit as trumps. \nIf the new turn up is the same suit as before, the dealer gives another three cards to each player and turns up another card, scoring again if it is an ace, jack or six. This procedure is repeated until the turn up produces a new trump suit. \nIf the deck is exhausted before a new trump suit is found, the entire deck is reshuffled and redealt. The dealer\'s team nevertheless keeps any points they have scored for turned up cards.\n\nPlay\nThe player on the dealer\'s right has the first lead, and the winner of the trick leads to the next trick. Any card can be led, but the other players are subject to the following rules:\n\nIf a trump is led, the other players must play a trump if they can; anyone who has no trumps left can play any card.\nIf a card of a non-trump suit is led, then any player who has a card of that suit must either follow suit, by playing a card of the suit led, or play a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led can play any card (there is no obligation to play a trump in this case).\n\nThe trick is won by the highest trump card played to it; if no trumps are played it is won by the highest card of the suit led. \n\nNote that the effect of these rules is that is is always legal to play a trump. The only play that is prohibited is to throw a non-trump card of a different suit from the lead when you could have followed suit. That would be a revoke or renege, and is penalised as explained below.\nPlay continues until all players have played all their cards. If the original trump suit was accepted there will be six tricks, but if a change of trump suit was begged for and allowed, the players will have larger hands and there will be 9 or 12 tricks, or possibly even more in a two-player game.\nScoring\nAt the end of the play, points are scored for the cards that were dealt or taken in tricks. The points are as follows:\n\nHigh1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who had the highest trump.\nLow1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who held the lowest trump that was dealt. It does not matter who wins the trick containing this trump - the point is for the original holders.\nJack1 or 3 pointsIf the jack of trumps wins a trick, or is won in a trick by the partner of the holder, the team with the jacks scores 1 point. If the jack is captured in a trick won by the opponents of the holder, the team capturing the jack scores 3 points for hang jack. If the jack of trumps was not dealt, then of course neither team scores for it.\nGame1 pointThis point goes to the team that wins the more valuable cards in tricks. For this purpose only, the top five cards in each suit have the following values: ace = 4, king = 3, queen = 2, jack = 1, ten = 10; other cards (2-9) have no value. Each team adds up the total value of the cards in their tricks, and whichever team has more scores the game point. If both teams have the same value of cards, no one gets the game point.\n\nEach team keeps a cumulative total of points they have won, and the first team to reach a total of 14 or more points over however many hands it takes wins the overall game. When nearing the end of a game, the points are counted strictly in the order high, low, jack, game to determine who has reached 14 first, so a tie is impossible. For example, suppose that at the start of a hand both teams have 13 points, that no points are scored for the turned up trump, and the trump suit is accepted. If team A has the highest trump, but team B win low, jack and game, then team A will win, because their point for high takes them to 14 before the other team can score.\nIrregularities\n\nMisdeal\nIf the dealer gives the wrong number of cards to the players, the opponents score one point for a misdeal, and the cards must be thrown in and shuffled and dealt again.\nRevoking - also called Reneging\nThis is playing a card of a non-trump card of a different suit from the card that was led when you could have followed suit. There is no penalty provided that the error is corrected by the player of the incorrect card before the end of the trick. An opposing player who notices the error may call the revoke at any time up to the end of the hand, and in that case the penalty is as follows. \n\nIf the player failed to follow a trump lead with trumps when they held one or more of the top five trumps, that player\'s team loses the whole of the game (14 points) currently in progress and a new game is started. \nIn other cases - a revoke on a non-trump lead or a failure to play a small trump on a trump lead - the opponents of the revoking player are awarded one point as a penalty, and the revoking team cannot win the point for game.\n\nCalling\nIf a player exposes a card other than in normal play, it must be left face up on the table. The opponents can then "call" for this card to be played on any subsequent trick, provided that playing it will not cause a revoke. \n\nVariations\nIn Tobago, it is the two rather than the six which scores two points when turned up.\nSome play that a player who has no trumps is forced to beg.\nSome play that "undertrumping" is not allowed. That is: if a non-trump suit is led and trumped, a later player is not allowed to play a lower trump unless he has no option.\nOther Trinidad All Fours web pages\nAs you might expect, Trinidad All Fours is also played in other places where there are people with a Trinidadian cultural background. For example, here is the web site of the Manitoba All Fours Association, in Canada.\nTrinidad All Fours software and on line games\nYou can obtain a Trinidad All Fours program at All Fours Online, which can be used to play against the computer or against an opponent on line. An online mobile phone version is also available.\nYou can play four-player Trinidad All Fours on line against live opponents at www.ttafo.com.\nWest Yorkshire All Fours\nAll Fours remains popular in parts of northern England. It is played in West Yorkshire pubs informally and on a league basis. Also Arthur Taylor, in his book of Pub Games reports a slightly different version played around Blackburn, Lancashire. I will describe the West Yorkshire version first, based on games played in 2003 in the Black Labrador pub, Batley, which belongs to the Heckmondwike league. I would like to thank the landlord John Dunning and his wife Anita for their help and hospitality.\nThere are four players in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. A standard 52 card pack is used, with the ace high and two low as usual. To begin the game, any player shuffles the cards, offers them to be cut by the player to the right, and deals the cards one at a time face up clockwise beginning with the player to their left until a jack appears.  The player who received the jack will pitch first, and the player to the right of the pitcher will deal the first hand.\nDeal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.  The dealer shuffles all the cards, and must offer them to the opponent to the right to cut.  The opponent may cut the cards or leave them as they are. The dealer deals six cards to each player, clockwise, in three rounds.  The number of cards dealt to each player in each round is at the choice of the dealer, for example all the cards may be dealt two at a time, or the dealer could deal one round three cards at a time, then one round two cards at a time and finish with a round of single cards.\nNo card is turned up for trumps. Instead, the pitcher (the player to dealer\'s left) leads (or "pitches") any card and the suit of that card is trumps for the hand. The pitcher\'s partner must not look at his or her cards until after the pitcher has led. This is to avoid any suspicion that the pitcher\'s partner might signal to the pitcher what suit to lead. (The penalty if the pitcher\'s partner breaks this rule is 4 points to the other team.)\nThe rules of play are the same as in Trinidad. A player who has a card of the suit led must either follow suit or trump. A player with no card of the suit led can play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump, or if it contains none, by the highest card of the suit led, and the winner leads to the next trick.\nThe first trick is stacked face up in front of one member of the team that won it, with a trump on top, to indicate the trump suit. Subsequent tricks are stored face down in front of one member of the winning team, in the usual way.\nIf you have no trumps and no valuable cards left (nothing higher than a nine), and you are not winning the current trick, you are allowed to indicate to your partner that your remaining cards are useless by throwing in your hand.  This is normally done by playing all your cards together, face up to the current trick.  You then take no further part in the play, and your partner continues alone.\nWhen the six tricks have been played, points are awarded in order as follows.\n\nHigh: the team that has the highest trump pegs one point.\nLow: the team that was dealt the lowest trump scores one point.\nJack: the team that wins the trick containing the jack of trumps scores one point. If the Jack was not dealt, this point is not awarded.\nGame: the team whose tricks have the highest total value of cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 in all four suits as usual, score one point. In the unusual case where both teams have exactly the same total value of cards in their tricks, neither team scores the point for game.\n\n\n\nThe points are pegged on a special wooden peg board, and the first team to reach 11 points wins. In the event that both teams are close to winning, the points are always pegged in the order high, low, jack, game.  So, for example, if the score is 10-10 the team holding the highest trump will win the match, even if the other team would have won the other three points.\nWhen playing for money, it is usual to agree a stake for winning the match, and an additional stake for winning all four points in one hand.  For example, if playing 2 pounds and 1 pound, if team A scores all four twice and wins the match, while team B scores all four once, each member of team A would receive 3 pounds (2+1+1-1) and each member of team B would pay 3 pounds.\nWhen there is a payment for \'all four\', the play of the last hand of a match must be continued as long as there is a chance of \'all four\' being made, even if the result of the match is already settled.  (For example, a team with 10 points pitches the ace of trumps, winning the match, but can continue playing to try to make all four on the hand, but if an opponent has the trump 2, play can end, since there is nothing more at stake.)\nTactics\nThe choice of pitch is of great importance.  Since this first card fixes the trump suit, it determines who will win two of the four possible points: high and low.  A short suit containing the ace is preferable to a longer suit of intermediate cards; a suit containing the ace and two, for two sure points, is ideal.  The jack may yield a point if protected by other cards in the same suit, but it would be better to pitch a bare ace or even a two for a sure point than (say) the eight from J-8 for a possible point if your jack is not caught.  However, a jack in a three-card suit can usually be saved, so for example J-9-2 would be a better suit to pitch from than A-6.  Lacking aces, it may be worth choosing a suit headed by a king or even a queen.  Since only 24 of the 52 cards are dealt out, your king or queen could score the high point if no one has the top card(s) of the suit.\nIn the play, do not be too concerned with winning tricks, unless they are of some value.  Rather than win a cheap trick it is often better to leave an opponent \'in\' (i.e. with the lead), so that your side will play last to the next trick.\nThe most important objective of the play is to catch or save the jack of trumps, if it has been dealt.  If you have one of the top three trumps, and suspect the opponents may have the jack, it is worth saving your top card until you can catch the jack.\nAs far as the game point is concerned, the most important cards are the tens, which account for half the value of the pack, but are difficult to save since they are only the fifth highest cards of their suits.  If your partner is winning a trick in a suit which you are \'off\' (have no cards in), don\'t neglect to throw a ten of another suit into the trick if you have one.  When playing second to a trick, it is sometimes worth playing a ten in the hope that partner can win the trick.  Sometimes a player will \'push\' with a ten - offer it in the hope that the opponents will use a high trump to capture it.  A simple example would be to trump with the 10 holding J-10 in the hope that an opponent with a top trump would use it to catch the 10 and let you save your jack.\nAs in any game it is important to pay attention to the fall of the cards.  You cannot accurately count the suits, since over half the cards are undealt, but there are many inferences from the cards that are played or not played.  To begin with, anyone who does not play a trump to the first trick is off trumps, so their right-hand opponent can win tricks efficiently with small trumps or top cards of other suits.  Ideally you should be aware when players are off other suits, and also when any of your cards becomes a \'bobby\' - the highest outstanding card of its suit.\nTactics are affected to some extent by the score in the match.  If you are a long way behind it is worth taking risks to catch up; if you are ahead you should play safe.\nVariations\nWhen partnerships are not arranged in advance, at the start of the game cards are dealt around face up until all four jacks have appeared (a player who has received a jack is dealt no more cards). The people with the two red jacks are partners against those with the black jacks. The same procedure can be used when there are more than four people wishing to play. The four who received the jacks play and the others wait for a future opportunity to join in.\nSome cut to decide first pitch - highest card pitches first.\nIn some places \'trumping in\' is not allowed.  In these places you are only allowed to play a trump if a trump is led, or if you are unable to follow suit to a non-trump lead. One correspondent told me that the (original) version of the rules, in which a trump can be played at any time, is known as \'Batley Carr Rules\' or \'Scarborough Rules\'. Another tells me that trumping in is allowed in Holmfirth, but 3 miles away in Honley it is not.\nIt is possible for six people to play, in three teams of two, or two people to play against each other. The rules of play and scoring are exactly the same is for four players; the two-player game is played to 9 points and the six-player game to 11 points.\nIn the Heckmondwike league, when two pubs compete, each pub fields eight players, and they play four simultaneous matches to 15 points.  The winners of each score two match points and another two match points are scored by the pub with the higher total game point score over the four tables.  There is no bonus for "all four" in the league version.\nLancashire All Fours\nAccording to Arthur Taylor\'s book of Pub Games (St Albans, 1976; Guinness, 1992), All Fours is played in Blackburn in casual games and in several leagues. Rules are similar to the Yorkshire version described above, with a few differences.\n\nTo begin the game the cards are cut for first pitch. A player of one team cuts and a player of the other team must guess whether the cut card is red or black: if the guesser is right, the guesser\'s team selects a player to pitch first; if not, a player of the cutting team pitches first.The point for Low goes to the team that wins the trick containing the lowest trump dealt, not the original holder of the card, as in other versions.\nArthur Taylor does not mention that the first trick is stored face up, nor that a player without trumps or counting cards can throw their hand in. The natural assumption would therefore be that all tricks are stored face down, and that all players keep playing to the last trick, even if they have no useful cards left.\n\n17th Century English All-Fours\nThe earliest description of All Fours that I know of was published in Charles Cotton\'s "Compleat Gamester" (1674). According to this account, the game was much played in Kent, and originated in that county. It was a game for two players, using the 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen by cutting cards - whoever cuts the highest "Put-card" deals. [This apparently means that when cutting for deal, the cards rank from high to low 3-2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4 as in the contemporary game of Put. For all other purposes, however, the cards rank A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2 as usual. It is not mentioned, but presumably the dealer shuffles and the dealer\'s opponent cuts before the deal. Presumably the turn to deal alternates between the players.]\nThe dealer deals six cards to each player in batches of three and turns up the next card, the 13th, to show the proposed trump suit, scoring one point if it is a jack. The dealer\'s opponent can either accept the trump suit or beg one. If the non-dealer begs, the dealer must either allow the non-dealer to score one point and throw in the cards, or deal another three cards each and turn another card for trumps, repeating this until a different suit is turned. [It is unclear how the point for a turned up jack is treated if the trump suit is changed. It could either be like the modern Trinidad game, in which all turned jacks are scored, or like the 19th century American game, in which only the jack of the final trump suit can be scored.]\nThe non-dealer leads to the first trick and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The higher trump wins, or if no trump is played, the higher card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nWhen all the cards have been played, points are scored in order as follows:\n\nHighest: one point for the holder of the highest trump dealt.\nLowest: one point for the original holder of the lowest trump dealt.\nJack: one point for a player who wins a trick containing the jack of trumps.\nGame: one point for the player whose tricks contain the higher value in cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 as usual.\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the agreed target score, which can be from 7 to 15, but is most commonly set at 11.\n\nA variation called Running All-Fours is briefly described. This is played to a target score of 31 points, and the only other difference is that in the deal, the dealer scores 4 points if the turned up trump is an ace, 3 is it is a king, 2 if it is a queen or 1 if it is a jack.\nNorth American All Fours, Old Sledge or Seven Up\nTo judge from the literature, All Fours became very popular in North America in the 19th century. In the 20th century it was largely superseded by bidding variations such as Pitch and Pedro.\nIn American card game books of the early 19th century, All Fours is a two-player game, very similar to the 17th century English game described above. When cutting for deal the cards now rank in their normal order with ace high, and the deal can be one or three cards at a time at the dealer\'s choice. Many play that if the non-dealer begs and the dealer decides to change the trump suit, then after the necessary extra cards have been dealt, the players discard unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. The target score is 10 points.\nThe version of All Fours described by R.F.Foster in 1897 goes by the name of Old Sledge or Seven Up. It can be played by two or three players, each playing for themselves, or by four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The deal and play are clockwise and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The dealer deals six cards to each player, three at a time, and then turns up a card to show the proposed trump suit.\nThe player to dealer\'s left may beg, and dealer has the usual options.\n\nSay "Take it", and play with the proposed trump suit, allowing the opponent(s) to score one point for gift.  If there are three players, both opponents score, but if the opponent who did not beg needs only one point for game, he is not allowed to win in this way, so presumably the dealer is forced to run the cards in that case.\nChange the trump suit by running the cards. The dealer deals three more cards to each player and turns up another card; if it is the same suit as the first one, he repeats this until a new suit is turned up for trumps. If the deck is exhausted, the cards are bunched - the cards are thrown in, shuffled and redealt by the same dealer.\n\nAfter the cards have been run, any player who does not like the second trump suit can propose to bunch the cards. If all players agree there is a redeal by the same dealer, but anyone can insist on playing with the new trumps and no points are given for this.\n\nIf a jack is turned up for trump, the dealer (or dealer\'s team) scores one point for it, but if the cards are run, no point is scored for a jack turned up in the original turned suit, and no point is scored if the cards are bunched. The point is only scored if the turned up card that finally determines trumps is a jack.\nAfter the cards have been run and a new trump suit determined, all players discard face-down sufficient unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. In some circles this was only done if the players had 12 or more cards, but if the cards were run only once, the players kept and played with their 9-card hands.\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The highest trump wins, or if no trump is played, the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nThere are the usual four points: High, Low, Jack and Game, scored in that order, with the Low point going to the original holder of the card, not the player who wins it in a trick. In the event of a tie for Game in the two- or four-player game, the point goes to the opponent(s) of the dealer. This is meant to compensate to some extent for the dealer\'s advantage in being able to score a point if a jack is turned for trumps. In a three-player game, if the two non-dealers tie for the Game point no one gets it, but if the dealer ties with another player, the other player gets it.\nThe game is usually played to seven points. Each player or team starts with seven chips, and places one in the pool for each point they win; the winner is the first player or team to have placed all their chips in the pool.\nFoster describes a variation called Blind All Fours or Pitch in which no card is turned for trumps and there is no begging or running of the cards. In this game the first card pitched by the player to dealer\'s left fixes the trump suit (as in Lancashire All Fours). In this game, when the Game point is tied no one gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > All Fours Group > All Fours\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2003, 2007.

It was taken to the USA, where it became very popular in the 19th century and gave rise to numerous other games. Meanwhile All Fours itself has become the national game of Trinidad, where it is sometimes known as All Foes, and it continues to be played in England, in Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nAll Fours in Trinidad\nWith thanks to Glen Benjamin for explaining the modern Trinidad game to me.\nPlayers, cards and objective\nNormally there are four players, in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other. It is also possible, but less usual, for two people to play. \nA standard 52 card pack is used. In each suit, the cards rank from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nThe object of the game is to score points by winning tricks with valuable cards in them. The player or team that takes more valuable cards in tricks will score one point for "game". In addition, there are points for taking the jack of trumps in a trick, and for the holders of the highest and lowest trumps dealt. It is also possible for the dealer\'s team to score points for the card turned up for trumps during the deal.\nDeal\nPlayers cut for the deal, and whoever cuts the highest card becomes the first dealer. Deal and play are anticlockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the right after each hand. Each player is dealt six cards. The dealer can choose whether to deal the cards one at a time or in batches of three, but having chosen must stick to the same method for the whole game.\nWhen everyone has six cards, the dealer turns the next card face up to indicate the trump suit. If this turned up card is an ace, six or jack, the dealer\'s team immediately scores for it as follows:\n\nAce turned up . . . 1 point\nSix turned up . . . 2 points\nJack turned up . . . 3 points\n\nIf the player on the dealer\'s right is happy with the trump suit that is shown by the turn up, he says "Stand" and play begins. If the player on the dealer\'s right would prefer a different trump suit, he says, "I beg". The dealer then has the option to change trumps or to keep the suit of the turned up card as trumps. \nIf the dealer decides to keep the trumps as turned up, he says, "Take one"; the opponents of the dealer receive one point and play begins. \nIf the dealer agrees to change the trump suit, he sets aside the turned up card, deals three more cards to each player, and then turns up the next card to determine the trump suit, scoring for it as above if it is an ace, jack or six. \n\nIf this new turn up is of a different suit than the first turn up, play begins with this new suit as trumps. \nIf the new turn up is the same suit as before, the dealer gives another three cards to each player and turns up another card, scoring again if it is an ace, jack or six. This procedure is repeated until the turn up produces a new trump suit. \nIf the deck is exhausted before a new trump suit is found, the entire deck is reshuffled and redealt. The dealer\'s team nevertheless keeps any points they have scored for turned up cards.\n\nPlay\nThe player on the dealer\'s right has the first lead, and the winner of the trick leads to the next trick. Any card can be led, but the other players are subject to the following rules:\n\nIf a trump is led, the other players must play a trump if they can; anyone who has no trumps left can play any card.\nIf a card of a non-trump suit is led, then any player who has a card of that suit must either follow suit, by playing a card of the suit led, or play a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led can play any card (there is no obligation to play a trump in this case).\n\nThe trick is won by the highest trump card played to it; if no trumps are played it is won by the highest card of the suit led. \n\nNote that the effect of these rules is that is is always legal to play a trump. The only play that is prohibited is to throw a non-trump card of a different suit from the lead when you could have followed suit. That would be a revoke or renege, and is penalised as explained below.\nPlay continues until all players have played all their cards. If the original trump suit was accepted there will be six tricks, but if a change of trump suit was begged for and allowed, the players will have larger hands and there will be 9 or 12 tricks, or possibly even more in a two-player game.\nScoring\nAt the end of the play, points are scored for the cards that were dealt or taken in tricks. The points are as follows:\n\nHigh1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who had the highest trump.\nLow1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who held the lowest trump that was dealt. It does not matter who wins the trick containing this trump - the point is for the original holders.\nJack1 or 3 pointsIf the jack of trumps wins a trick, or is won in a trick by the partner of the holder, the team with the jacks scores 1 point. If the jack is captured in a trick won by the opponents of the holder, the team capturing the jack scores 3 points for hang jack. If the jack of trumps was not dealt, then of course neither team scores for it.\nGame1 pointThis point goes to the team that wins the more valuable cards in tricks. For this purpose only, the top five cards in each suit have the following values: ace = 4, king = 3, queen = 2, jack = 1, ten = 10; other cards (2-9) have no value. Each team adds up the total value of the cards in their tricks, and whichever team has more scores the game point. If both teams have the same value of cards, no one gets the game point.\n\nEach team keeps a cumulative total of points they have won, and the first team to reach a total of 14 or more points over however many hands it takes wins the overall game. When nearing the end of a game, the points are counted strictly in the order high, low, jack, game to determine who has reached 14 first, so a tie is impossible. For example, suppose that at the start of a hand both teams have 13 points, that no points are scored for the turned up trump, and the trump suit is accepted. If team A has the highest trump, but team B win low, jack and game, then team A will win, because their point for high takes them to 14 before the other team can score.\nIrregularities\n\nMisdeal\nIf the dealer gives the wrong number of cards to the players, the opponents score one point for a misdeal, and the cards must be thrown in and shuffled and dealt again.\nRevoking - also called Reneging\nThis is playing a card of a non-trump card of a different suit from the card that was led when you could have followed suit. There is no penalty provided that the error is corrected by the player of the incorrect card before the end of the trick. An opposing player who notices the error may call the revoke at any time up to the end of the hand, and in that case the penalty is as follows. \n\nIf the player failed to follow a trump lead with trumps when they held one or more of the top five trumps, that player\'s team loses the whole of the game (14 points) currently in progress and a new game is started. \nIn other cases - a revoke on a non-trump lead or a failure to play a small trump on a trump lead - the opponents of the revoking player are awarded one point as a penalty, and the revoking team cannot win the point for game.\n\nCalling\nIf a player exposes a card other than in normal play, it must be left face up on the table. The opponents can then "call" for this card to be played on any subsequent trick, provided that playing it will not cause a revoke. \n\nVariations\nIn Tobago, it is the two rather than the six which scores two points when turned up.\nSome play that a player who has no trumps is forced to beg.\nSome play that "undertrumping" is not allowed. That is: if a non-trump suit is led and trumped, a later player is not allowed to play a lower trump unless he has no option.\nOther Trinidad All Fours web pages\nAs you might expect, Trinidad All Fours is also played in other places where there are people with a Trinidadian cultural background. For example, here is the web site of the Manitoba All Fours Association, in Canada.\nTrinidad All Fours software and on line games\nYou can obtain a Trinidad All Fours program at All Fours Online, which can be used to play against the computer or against an opponent on line. An online mobile phone version is also available.\nYou can play four-player Trinidad All Fours on line against live opponents at www.ttafo.com.\nWest Yorkshire All Fours\nAll Fours remains popular in parts of northern England. It is played in West Yorkshire pubs informally and on a league basis. Also Arthur Taylor, in his book of Pub Games reports a slightly different version played around Blackburn, Lancashire. I will describe the West Yorkshire version first, based on games played in 2003 in the Black Labrador pub, Batley, which belongs to the Heckmondwike league. I would like to thank the landlord John Dunning and his wife Anita for their help and hospitality.\nThere are four players in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. A standard 52 card pack is used, with the ace high and two low as usual. To begin the game, any player shuffles the cards, offers them to be cut by the player to the right, and deals the cards one at a time face up clockwise beginning with the player to their left until a jack appears.  The player who received the jack will pitch first, and the player to the right of the pitcher will deal the first hand.\nDeal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.  The dealer shuffles all the cards, and must offer them to the opponent to the right to cut.  The opponent may cut the cards or leave them as they are. The dealer deals six cards to each player, clockwise, in three rounds.  The number of cards dealt to each player in each round is at the choice of the dealer, for example all the cards may be dealt two at a time, or the dealer could deal one round three cards at a time, then one round two cards at a time and finish with a round of single cards.\nNo card is turned up for trumps. Instead, the pitcher (the player to dealer\'s left) leads (or "pitches") any card and the suit of that card is trumps for the hand. The pitcher\'s partner must not look at his or her cards until after the pitcher has led. This is to avoid any suspicion that the pitcher\'s partner might signal to the pitcher what suit to lead. (The penalty if the pitcher\'s partner breaks this rule is 4 points to the other team.)\nThe rules of play are the same as in Trinidad. A player who has a card of the suit led must either follow suit or trump. A player with no card of the suit led can play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump, or if it contains none, by the highest card of the suit led, and the winner leads to the next trick.\nThe first trick is stacked face up in front of one member of the team that won it, with a trump on top, to indicate the trump suit. Subsequent tricks are stored face down in front of one member of the winning team, in the usual way.\nIf you have no trumps and no valuable cards left (nothing higher than a nine), and you are not winning the current trick, you are allowed to indicate to your partner that your remaining cards are useless by throwing in your hand.  This is normally done by playing all your cards together, face up to the current trick.  You then take no further part in the play, and your partner continues alone.\nWhen the six tricks have been played, points are awarded in order as follows.\n\nHigh: the team that has the highest trump pegs one point.\nLow: the team that was dealt the lowest trump scores one point.\nJack: the team that wins the trick containing the jack of trumps scores one point. If the Jack was not dealt, this point is not awarded.\nGame: the team whose tricks have the highest total value of cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 in all four suits as usual, score one point. In the unusual case where both teams have exactly the same total value of cards in their tricks, neither team scores the point for game.\n\n\n\nThe points are pegged on a special wooden peg board, and the first team to reach 11 points wins. In the event that both teams are close to winning, the points are always pegged in the order high, low, jack, game.  So, for example, if the score is 10-10 the team holding the highest trump will win the match, even if the other team would have won the other three points.\nWhen playing for money, it is usual to agree a stake for winning the match, and an additional stake for winning all four points in one hand.  For example, if playing 2 pounds and 1 pound, if team A scores all four twice and wins the match, while team B scores all four once, each member of team A would receive 3 pounds (2+1+1-1) and each member of team B would pay 3 pounds.\nWhen there is a payment for \'all four\', the play of the last hand of a match must be continued as long as there is a chance of \'all four\' being made, even if the result of the match is already settled.  (For example, a team with 10 points pitches the ace of trumps, winning the match, but can continue playing to try to make all four on the hand, but if an opponent has the trump 2, play can end, since there is nothing more at stake.)\nTactics\nThe choice of pitch is of great importance.  Since this first card fixes the trump suit, it determines who will win two of the four possible points: high and low.  A short suit containing the ace is preferable to a longer suit of intermediate cards; a suit containing the ace and two, for two sure points, is ideal.  The jack may yield a point if protected by other cards in the same suit, but it would be better to pitch a bare ace or even a two for a sure point than (say) the eight from J-8 for a possible point if your jack is not caught.  However, a jack in a three-card suit can usually be saved, so for example J-9-2 would be a better suit to pitch from than A-6.  Lacking aces, it may be worth choosing a suit headed by a king or even a queen.  Since only 24 of the 52 cards are dealt out, your king or queen could score the high point if no one has the top card(s) of the suit.\nIn the play, do not be too concerned with winning tricks, unless they are of some value.  Rather than win a cheap trick it is often better to leave an opponent \'in\' (i.e. with the lead), so that your side will play last to the next trick.\nThe most important objective of the play is to catch or save the jack of trumps, if it has been dealt.  If you have one of the top three trumps, and suspect the opponents may have the jack, it is worth saving your top card until you can catch the jack.\nAs far as the game point is concerned, the most important cards are the tens, which account for half the value of the pack, but are difficult to save since they are only the fifth highest cards of their suits.  If your partner is winning a trick in a suit which you are \'off\' (have no cards in), don\'t neglect to throw a ten of another suit into the trick if you have one.  When playing second to a trick, it is sometimes worth playing a ten in the hope that partner can win the trick.  Sometimes a player will \'push\' with a ten - offer it in the hope that the opponents will use a high trump to capture it.  A simple example would be to trump with the 10 holding J-10 in the hope that an opponent with a top trump would use it to catch the 10 and let you save your jack.\nAs in any game it is important to pay attention to the fall of the cards.  You cannot accurately count the suits, since over half the cards are undealt, but there are many inferences from the cards that are played or not played.  To begin with, anyone who does not play a trump to the first trick is off trumps, so their right-hand opponent can win tricks efficiently with small trumps or top cards of other suits.  Ideally you should be aware when players are off other suits, and also when any of your cards becomes a \'bobby\' - the highest outstanding card of its suit.\nTactics are affected to some extent by the score in the match.  If you are a long way behind it is worth taking risks to catch up; if you are ahead you should play safe.\nVariations\nWhen partnerships are not arranged in advance, at the start of the game cards are dealt around face up until all four jacks have appeared (a player who has received a jack is dealt no more cards). The people with the two red jacks are partners against those with the black jacks. The same procedure can be used when there are more than four people wishing to play. The four who received the jacks play and the others wait for a future opportunity to join in.\nSome cut to decide first pitch - highest card pitches first.\nIn some places \'trumping in\' is not allowed.  In these places you are only allowed to play a trump if a trump is led, or if you are unable to follow suit to a non-trump lead. One correspondent told me that the (original) version of the rules, in which a trump can be played at any time, is known as \'Batley Carr Rules\' or \'Scarborough Rules\'. Another tells me that trumping in is allowed in Holmfirth, but 3 miles away in Honley it is not.\nIt is possible for six people to play, in three teams of two, or two people to play against each other. The rules of play and scoring are exactly the same is for four players; the two-player game is played to 9 points and the six-player game to 11 points.\nIn the Heckmondwike league, when two pubs compete, each pub fields eight players, and they play four simultaneous matches to 15 points.  The winners of each score two match points and another two match points are scored by the pub with the higher total game point score over the four tables.  There is no bonus for "all four" in the league version.\nLancashire All Fours\nAccording to Arthur Taylor\'s book of Pub Games (St Albans, 1976; Guinness, 1992), All Fours is played in Blackburn in casual games and in several leagues. Rules are similar to the Yorkshire version described above, with a few differences.\n\nTo begin the game the cards are cut for first pitch. A player of one team cuts and a player of the other team must guess whether the cut card is red or black: if the guesser is right, the guesser\'s team selects a player to pitch first; if not, a player of the cutting team pitches first.The point for Low goes to the team that wins the trick containing the lowest trump dealt, not the original holder of the card, as in other versions.\nArthur Taylor does not mention that the first trick is stored face up, nor that a player without trumps or counting cards can throw their hand in. The natural assumption would therefore be that all tricks are stored face down, and that all players keep playing to the last trick, even if they have no useful cards left.\n\n17th Century English All-Fours\nThe earliest description of All Fours that I know of was published in Charles Cotton\'s "Compleat Gamester" (1674). According to this account, the game was much played in Kent, and originated in that county. It was a game for two players, using the 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen by cutting cards - whoever cuts the highest "Put-card" deals. [This apparently means that when cutting for deal, the cards rank from high to low 3-2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4 as in the contemporary game of Put. For all other purposes, however, the cards rank A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2 as usual. It is not mentioned, but presumably the dealer shuffles and the dealer\'s opponent cuts before the deal. Presumably the turn to deal alternates between the players.]\nThe dealer deals six cards to each player in batches of three and turns up the next card, the 13th, to show the proposed trump suit, scoring one point if it is a jack. The dealer\'s opponent can either accept the trump suit or beg one. If the non-dealer begs, the dealer must either allow the non-dealer to score one point and throw in the cards, or deal another three cards each and turn another card for trumps, repeating this until a different suit is turned. [It is unclear how the point for a turned up jack is treated if the trump suit is changed. It could either be like the modern Trinidad game, in which all turned jacks are scored, or like the 19th century American game, in which only the jack of the final trump suit can be scored.]\nThe non-dealer leads to the first trick and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The higher trump wins, or if no trump is played, the higher card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nWhen all the cards have been played, points are scored in order as follows:\n\nHighest: one point for the holder of the highest trump dealt.\nLowest: one point for the original holder of the lowest trump dealt.\nJack: one point for a player who wins a trick containing the jack of trumps.\nGame: one point for the player whose tricks contain the higher value in cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 as usual.\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the agreed target score, which can be from 7 to 15, but is most commonly set at 11.\n\nA variation called Running All-Fours is briefly described. This is played to a target score of 31 points, and the only other difference is that in the deal, the dealer scores 4 points if the turned up trump is an ace, 3 is it is a king, 2 if it is a queen or 1 if it is a jack.\nNorth American All Fours, Old Sledge or Seven Up\nTo judge from the literature, All Fours became very popular in North America in the 19th century. In the 20th century it was largely superseded by bidding variations such as Pitch and Pedro.\nIn American card game books of the early 19th century, All Fours is a two-player game, very similar to the 17th century English game described above. When cutting for deal the cards now rank in their normal order with ace high, and the deal can be one or three cards at a time at the dealer\'s choice. Many play that if the non-dealer begs and the dealer decides to change the trump suit, then after the necessary extra cards have been dealt, the players discard unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. The target score is 10 points.\nThe version of All Fours described by R.F.Foster in 1897 goes by the name of Old Sledge or Seven Up. It can be played by two or three players, each playing for themselves, or by four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The deal and play are clockwise and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The dealer deals six cards to each player, three at a time, and then turns up a card to show the proposed trump suit.\nThe player to dealer\'s left may beg, and dealer has the usual options.\n\nSay "Take it", and play with the proposed trump suit, allowing the opponent(s) to score one point for gift.  If there are three players, both opponents score, but if the opponent who did not beg needs only one point for game, he is not allowed to win in this way, so presumably the dealer is forced to run the cards in that case.\nChange the trump suit by running the cards. The dealer deals three more cards to each player and turns up another card; if it is the same suit as the first one, he repeats this until a new suit is turned up for trumps. If the deck is exhausted, the cards are bunched - the cards are thrown in, shuffled and redealt by the same dealer.\n\nAfter the cards have been run, any player who does not like the second trump suit can propose to bunch the cards. If all players agree there is a redeal by the same dealer, but anyone can insist on playing with the new trumps and no points are given for this.\n\nIf a jack is turned up for trump, the dealer (or dealer\'s team) scores one point for it, but if the cards are run, no point is scored for a jack turned up in the original turned suit, and no point is scored if the cards are bunched. The point is only scored if the turned up card that finally determines trumps is a jack.\nAfter the cards have been run and a new trump suit determined, all players discard face-down sufficient unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. In some circles this was only done if the players had 12 or more cards, but if the cards were run only once, the players kept and played with their 9-card hands.\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The highest trump wins, or if no trump is played, the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nThere are the usual four points: High, Low, Jack and Game, scored in that order, with the Low point going to the original holder of the card, not the player who wins it in a trick. In the event of a tie for Game in the two- or four-player game, the point goes to the opponent(s) of the dealer. This is meant to compensate to some extent for the dealer\'s advantage in being able to score a point if a jack is turned for trumps. In a three-player game, if the two non-dealers tie for the Game point no one gets it, but if the dealer ties with another player, the other player gets it.\nThe game is usually played to seven points. Each player or team starts with seven chips, and places one in the pool for each point they win; the winner is the first player or team to have placed all their chips in the pool.\nFoster describes a variation called Blind All Fours or Pitch in which no card is turned for trumps and there is no begging or running of the cards. In this game the first card pitched by the player to dealer\'s left fixes the trump suit (as in Lancashire All Fours). In this game, when the Game point is tied no one gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > All Fours Group > All Fours\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2003, 2007.

It was taken to the USA, where it became very popular in the 19th century and gave rise to numerous other games. Meanwhile All Fours itself has become the national game of Trinidad, where it is sometimes known as All Foes, and it continues to be played in England, in Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nAll Fours in Trinidad\nWith thanks to Glen Benjamin for explaining the modern Trinidad game to me.\nPlayers, cards and objective\nNormally there are four players, in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other. It is also possible, but less usual, for two people to play. \nA standard 52 card pack is used. In each suit, the cards rank from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nThe object of the game is to score points by winning tricks with valuable cards in them. The player or team that takes more valuable cards in tricks will score one point for "game". In addition, there are points for taking the jack of trumps in a trick, and for the holders of the highest and lowest trumps dealt. It is also possible for the dealer\'s team to score points for the card turned up for trumps during the deal.\nDeal\nPlayers cut for the deal, and whoever cuts the highest card becomes the first dealer. Deal and play are anticlockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the right after each hand. Each player is dealt six cards. The dealer can choose whether to deal the cards one at a time or in batches of three, but having chosen must stick to the same method for the whole game.\nWhen everyone has six cards, the dealer turns the next card face up to indicate the trump suit. If this turned up card is an ace, six or jack, the dealer\'s team immediately scores for it as follows:\n\nAce turned up . . . 1 point\nSix turned up . . . 2 points\nJack turned up . . . 3 points\n\nIf the player on the dealer\'s right is happy with the trump suit that is shown by the turn up, he says "Stand" and play begins. If the player on the dealer\'s right would prefer a different trump suit, he says, "I beg". The dealer then has the option to change trumps or to keep the suit of the turned up card as trumps. \nIf the dealer decides to keep the trumps as turned up, he says, "Take one"; the opponents of the dealer receive one point and play begins. \nIf the dealer agrees to change the trump suit, he sets aside the turned up card, deals three more cards to each player, and then turns up the next card to determine the trump suit, scoring for it as above if it is an ace, jack or six. \n\nIf this new turn up is of a different suit than the first turn up, play begins with this new suit as trumps. \nIf the new turn up is the same suit as before, the dealer gives another three cards to each player and turns up another card, scoring again if it is an ace, jack or six. This procedure is repeated until the turn up produces a new trump suit. \nIf the deck is exhausted before a new trump suit is found, the entire deck is reshuffled and redealt. The dealer\'s team nevertheless keeps any points they have scored for turned up cards.\n\nPlay\nThe player on the dealer\'s right has the first lead, and the winner of the trick leads to the next trick. Any card can be led, but the other players are subject to the following rules:\n\nIf a trump is led, the other players must play a trump if they can; anyone who has no trumps left can play any card.\nIf a card of a non-trump suit is led, then any player who has a card of that suit must either follow suit, by playing a card of the suit led, or play a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led can play any card (there is no obligation to play a trump in this case).\n\nThe trick is won by the highest trump card played to it; if no trumps are played it is won by the highest card of the suit led. \n\nNote that the effect of these rules is that is is always legal to play a trump. The only play that is prohibited is to throw a non-trump card of a different suit from the lead when you could have followed suit. That would be a revoke or renege, and is penalised as explained below.\nPlay continues until all players have played all their cards. If the original trump suit was accepted there will be six tricks, but if a change of trump suit was begged for and allowed, the players will have larger hands and there will be 9 or 12 tricks, or possibly even more in a two-player game.\nScoring\nAt the end of the play, points are scored for the cards that were dealt or taken in tricks. The points are as follows:\n\nHigh1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who had the highest trump.\nLow1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who held the lowest trump that was dealt. It does not matter who wins the trick containing this trump - the point is for the original holders.\nJack1 or 3 pointsIf the jack of trumps wins a trick, or is won in a trick by the partner of the holder, the team with the jacks scores 1 point. If the jack is captured in a trick won by the opponents of the holder, the team capturing the jack scores 3 points for hang jack. If the jack of trumps was not dealt, then of course neither team scores for it.\nGame1 pointThis point goes to the team that wins the more valuable cards in tricks. For this purpose only, the top five cards in each suit have the following values: ace = 4, king = 3, queen = 2, jack = 1, ten = 10; other cards (2-9) have no value. Each team adds up the total value of the cards in their tricks, and whichever team has more scores the game point. If both teams have the same value of cards, no one gets the game point.\n\nEach team keeps a cumulative total of points they have won, and the first team to reach a total of 14 or more points over however many hands it takes wins the overall game. When nearing the end of a game, the points are counted strictly in the order high, low, jack, game to determine who has reached 14 first, so a tie is impossible. For example, suppose that at the start of a hand both teams have 13 points, that no points are scored for the turned up trump, and the trump suit is accepted. If team A has the highest trump, but team B win low, jack and game, then team A will win, because their point for high takes them to 14 before the other team can score.\nIrregularities\n\nMisdeal\nIf the dealer gives the wrong number of cards to the players, the opponents score one point for a misdeal, and the cards must be thrown in and shuffled and dealt again.\nRevoking - also called Reneging\nThis is playing a card of a non-trump card of a different suit from the card that was led when you could have followed suit. There is no penalty provided that the error is corrected by the player of the incorrect card before the end of the trick. An opposing player who notices the error may call the revoke at any time up to the end of the hand, and in that case the penalty is as follows. \n\nIf the player failed to follow a trump lead with trumps when they held one or more of the top five trumps, that player\'s team loses the whole of the game (14 points) currently in progress and a new game is started. \nIn other cases - a revoke on a non-trump lead or a failure to play a small trump on a trump lead - the opponents of the revoking player are awarded one point as a penalty, and the revoking team cannot win the point for game.\n\nCalling\nIf a player exposes a card other than in normal play, it must be left face up on the table. The opponents can then "call" for this card to be played on any subsequent trick, provided that playing it will not cause a revoke. \n\nVariations\nIn Tobago, it is the two rather than the six which scores two points when turned up.\nSome play that a player who has no trumps is forced to beg.\nSome play that "undertrumping" is not allowed. That is: if a non-trump suit is led and trumped, a later player is not allowed to play a lower trump unless he has no option.\nOther Trinidad All Fours web pages\nAs you might expect, Trinidad All Fours is also played in other places where there are people with a Trinidadian cultural background. For example, here is the web site of the Manitoba All Fours Association, in Canada.\nTrinidad All Fours software and on line games\nYou can obtain a Trinidad All Fours program at All Fours Online, which can be used to play against the computer or against an opponent on line. An online mobile phone version is also available.\nYou can play four-player Trinidad All Fours on line against live opponents at www.ttafo.com.\nWest Yorkshire All Fours\nAll Fours remains popular in parts of northern England. It is played in West Yorkshire pubs informally and on a league basis. Also Arthur Taylor, in his book of Pub Games reports a slightly different version played around Blackburn, Lancashire. I will describe the West Yorkshire version first, based on games played in 2003 in the Black Labrador pub, Batley, which belongs to the Heckmondwike league. I would like to thank the landlord John Dunning and his wife Anita for their help and hospitality.\nThere are four players in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. A standard 52 card pack is used, with the ace high and two low as usual. To begin the game, any player shuffles the cards, offers them to be cut by the player to the right, and deals the cards one at a time face up clockwise beginning with the player to their left until a jack appears.  The player who received the jack will pitch first, and the player to the right of the pitcher will deal the first hand.\nDeal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.  The dealer shuffles all the cards, and must offer them to the opponent to the right to cut.  The opponent may cut the cards or leave them as they are. The dealer deals six cards to each player, clockwise, in three rounds.  The number of cards dealt to each player in each round is at the choice of the dealer, for example all the cards may be dealt two at a time, or the dealer could deal one round three cards at a time, then one round two cards at a time and finish with a round of single cards.\nNo card is turned up for trumps. Instead, the pitcher (the player to dealer\'s left) leads (or "pitches") any card and the suit of that card is trumps for the hand. The pitcher\'s partner must not look at his or her cards until after the pitcher has led. This is to avoid any suspicion that the pitcher\'s partner might signal to the pitcher what suit to lead. (The penalty if the pitcher\'s partner breaks this rule is 4 points to the other team.)\nThe rules of play are the same as in Trinidad. A player who has a card of the suit led must either follow suit or trump. A player with no card of the suit led can play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump, or if it contains none, by the highest card of the suit led, and the winner leads to the next trick.\nThe first trick is stacked face up in front of one member of the team that won it, with a trump on top, to indicate the trump suit. Subsequent tricks are stored face down in front of one member of the winning team, in the usual way.\nIf you have no trumps and no valuable cards left (nothing higher than a nine), and you are not winning the current trick, you are allowed to indicate to your partner that your remaining cards are useless by throwing in your hand.  This is normally done by playing all your cards together, face up to the current trick.  You then take no further part in the play, and your partner continues alone.\nWhen the six tricks have been played, points are awarded in order as follows.\n\nHigh: the team that has the highest trump pegs one point.\nLow: the team that was dealt the lowest trump scores one point.\nJack: the team that wins the trick containing the jack of trumps scores one point. If the Jack was not dealt, this point is not awarded.\nGame: the team whose tricks have the highest total value of cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 in all four suits as usual, score one point. In the unusual case where both teams have exactly the same total value of cards in their tricks, neither team scores the point for game.\n\n\n\nThe points are pegged on a special wooden peg board, and the first team to reach 11 points wins. In the event that both teams are close to winning, the points are always pegged in the order high, low, jack, game.  So, for example, if the score is 10-10 the team holding the highest trump will win the match, even if the other team would have won the other three points.\nWhen playing for money, it is usual to agree a stake for winning the match, and an additional stake for winning all four points in one hand.  For example, if playing 2 pounds and 1 pound, if team A scores all four twice and wins the match, while team B scores all four once, each member of team A would receive 3 pounds (2+1+1-1) and each member of team B would pay 3 pounds.\nWhen there is a payment for \'all four\', the play of the last hand of a match must be continued as long as there is a chance of \'all four\' being made, even if the result of the match is already settled.  (For example, a team with 10 points pitches the ace of trumps, winning the match, but can continue playing to try to make all four on the hand, but if an opponent has the trump 2, play can end, since there is nothing more at stake.)\nTactics\nThe choice of pitch is of great importance.  Since this first card fixes the trump suit, it determines who will win two of the four possible points: high and low.  A short suit containing the ace is preferable to a longer suit of intermediate cards; a suit containing the ace and two, for two sure points, is ideal.  The jack may yield a point if protected by other cards in the same suit, but it would be better to pitch a bare ace or even a two for a sure point than (say) the eight from J-8 for a possible point if your jack is not caught.  However, a jack in a three-card suit can usually be saved, so for example J-9-2 would be a better suit to pitch from than A-6.  Lacking aces, it may be worth choosing a suit headed by a king or even a queen.  Since only 24 of the 52 cards are dealt out, your king or queen could score the high point if no one has the top card(s) of the suit.\nIn the play, do not be too concerned with winning tricks, unless they are of some value.  Rather than win a cheap trick it is often better to leave an opponent \'in\' (i.e. with the lead), so that your side will play last to the next trick.\nThe most important objective of the play is to catch or save the jack of trumps, if it has been dealt.  If you have one of the top three trumps, and suspect the opponents may have the jack, it is worth saving your top card until you can catch the jack.\nAs far as the game point is concerned, the most important cards are the tens, which account for half the value of the pack, but are difficult to save since they are only the fifth highest cards of their suits.  If your partner is winning a trick in a suit which you are \'off\' (have no cards in), don\'t neglect to throw a ten of another suit into the trick if you have one.  When playing second to a trick, it is sometimes worth playing a ten in the hope that partner can win the trick.  Sometimes a player will \'push\' with a ten - offer it in the hope that the opponents will use a high trump to capture it.  A simple example would be to trump with the 10 holding J-10 in the hope that an opponent with a top trump would use it to catch the 10 and let you save your jack.\nAs in any game it is important to pay attention to the fall of the cards.  You cannot accurately count the suits, since over half the cards are undealt, but there are many inferences from the cards that are played or not played.  To begin with, anyone who does not play a trump to the first trick is off trumps, so their right-hand opponent can win tricks efficiently with small trumps or top cards of other suits.  Ideally you should be aware when players are off other suits, and also when any of your cards becomes a \'bobby\' - the highest outstanding card of its suit.\nTactics are affected to some extent by the score in the match.  If you are a long way behind it is worth taking risks to catch up; if you are ahead you should play safe.\nVariations\nWhen partnerships are not arranged in advance, at the start of the game cards are dealt around face up until all four jacks have appeared (a player who has received a jack is dealt no more cards). The people with the two red jacks are partners against those with the black jacks. The same procedure can be used when there are more than four people wishing to play. The four who received the jacks play and the others wait for a future opportunity to join in.\nSome cut to decide first pitch - highest card pitches first.\nIn some places \'trumping in\' is not allowed.  In these places you are only allowed to play a trump if a trump is led, or if you are unable to follow suit to a non-trump lead. One correspondent told me that the (original) version of the rules, in which a trump can be played at any time, is known as \'Batley Carr Rules\' or \'Scarborough Rules\'. Another tells me that trumping in is allowed in Holmfirth, but 3 miles away in Honley it is not.\nIt is possible for six people to play, in three teams of two, or two people to play against each other. The rules of play and scoring are exactly the same is for four players; the two-player game is played to 9 points and the six-player game to 11 points.\nIn the Heckmondwike league, when two pubs compete, each pub fields eight players, and they play four simultaneous matches to 15 points.  The winners of each score two match points and another two match points are scored by the pub with the higher total game point score over the four tables.  There is no bonus for "all four" in the league version.\nLancashire All Fours\nAccording to Arthur Taylor\'s book of Pub Games (St Albans, 1976; Guinness, 1992), All Fours is played in Blackburn in casual games and in several leagues. Rules are similar to the Yorkshire version described above, with a few differences.\n\nTo begin the game the cards are cut for first pitch. A player of one team cuts and a player of the other team must guess whether the cut card is red or black: if the guesser is right, the guesser\'s team selects a player to pitch first; if not, a player of the cutting team pitches first.The point for Low goes to the team that wins the trick containing the lowest trump dealt, not the original holder of the card, as in other versions.\nArthur Taylor does not mention that the first trick is stored face up, nor that a player without trumps or counting cards can throw their hand in. The natural assumption would therefore be that all tricks are stored face down, and that all players keep playing to the last trick, even if they have no useful cards left.\n\n17th Century English All-Fours\nThe earliest description of All Fours that I know of was published in Charles Cotton\'s "Compleat Gamester" (1674). According to this account, the game was much played in Kent, and originated in that county. It was a game for two players, using the 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen by cutting cards - whoever cuts the highest "Put-card" deals. [This apparently means that when cutting for deal, the cards rank from high to low 3-2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4 as in the contemporary game of Put. For all other purposes, however, the cards rank A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2 as usual. It is not mentioned, but presumably the dealer shuffles and the dealer\'s opponent cuts before the deal. Presumably the turn to deal alternates between the players.]\nThe dealer deals six cards to each player in batches of three and turns up the next card, the 13th, to show the proposed trump suit, scoring one point if it is a jack. The dealer\'s opponent can either accept the trump suit or beg one. If the non-dealer begs, the dealer must either allow the non-dealer to score one point and throw in the cards, or deal another three cards each and turn another card for trumps, repeating this until a different suit is turned. [It is unclear how the point for a turned up jack is treated if the trump suit is changed. It could either be like the modern Trinidad game, in which all turned jacks are scored, or like the 19th century American game, in which only the jack of the final trump suit can be scored.]\nThe non-dealer leads to the first trick and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The higher trump wins, or if no trump is played, the higher card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nWhen all the cards have been played, points are scored in order as follows:\n\nHighest: one point for the holder of the highest trump dealt.\nLowest: one point for the original holder of the lowest trump dealt.\nJack: one point for a player who wins a trick containing the jack of trumps.\nGame: one point for the player whose tricks contain the higher value in cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 as usual.\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the agreed target score, which can be from 7 to 15, but is most commonly set at 11.\n\nA variation called Running All-Fours is briefly described. This is played to a target score of 31 points, and the only other difference is that in the deal, the dealer scores 4 points if the turned up trump is an ace, 3 is it is a king, 2 if it is a queen or 1 if it is a jack.\nNorth American All Fours, Old Sledge or Seven Up\nTo judge from the literature, All Fours became very popular in North America in the 19th century. In the 20th century it was largely superseded by bidding variations such as Pitch and Pedro.\nIn American card game books of the early 19th century, All Fours is a two-player game, very similar to the 17th century English game described above. When cutting for deal the cards now rank in their normal order with ace high, and the deal can be one or three cards at a time at the dealer\'s choice. Many play that if the non-dealer begs and the dealer decides to change the trump suit, then after the necessary extra cards have been dealt, the players discard unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. The target score is 10 points.\nThe version of All Fours described by R.F.Foster in 1897 goes by the name of Old Sledge or Seven Up. It can be played by two or three players, each playing for themselves, or by four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The deal and play are clockwise and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The dealer deals six cards to each player, three at a time, and then turns up a card to show the proposed trump suit.\nThe player to dealer\'s left may beg, and dealer has the usual options.\n\nSay "Take it", and play with the proposed trump suit, allowing the opponent(s) to score one point for gift.  If there are three players, both opponents score, but if the opponent who did not beg needs only one point for game, he is not allowed to win in this way, so presumably the dealer is forced to run the cards in that case.\nChange the trump suit by running the cards. The dealer deals three more cards to each player and turns up another card; if it is the same suit as the first one, he repeats this until a new suit is turned up for trumps. If the deck is exhausted, the cards are bunched - the cards are thrown in, shuffled and redealt by the same dealer.\n\nAfter the cards have been run, any player who does not like the second trump suit can propose to bunch the cards. If all players agree there is a redeal by the same dealer, but anyone can insist on playing with the new trumps and no points are given for this.\n\nIf a jack is turned up for trump, the dealer (or dealer\'s team) scores one point for it, but if the cards are run, no point is scored for a jack turned up in the original turned suit, and no point is scored if the cards are bunched. The point is only scored if the turned up card that finally determines trumps is a jack.\nAfter the cards have been run and a new trump suit determined, all players discard face-down sufficient unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. In some circles this was only done if the players had 12 or more cards, but if the cards were run only once, the players kept and played with their 9-card hands.\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The highest trump wins, or if no trump is played, the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nThere are the usual four points: High, Low, Jack and Game, scored in that order, with the Low point going to the original holder of the card, not the player who wins it in a trick. In the event of a tie for Game in the two- or four-player game, the point goes to the opponent(s) of the dealer. This is meant to compensate to some extent for the dealer\'s advantage in being able to score a point if a jack is turned for trumps. In a three-player game, if the two non-dealers tie for the Game point no one gets it, but if the dealer ties with another player, the other player gets it.\nThe game is usually played to seven points. Each player or team starts with seven chips, and places one in the pool for each point they win; the winner is the first player or team to have placed all their chips in the pool.\nFoster describes a variation called Blind All Fours or Pitch in which no card is turned for trumps and there is no begging or running of the cards. In this game the first card pitched by the player to dealer\'s left fixes the trump suit (as in Lancashire All Fours). In this game, when the Game point is tied no one gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > All Fours Group > All Fours\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2003, 2007.

It was taken to the USA, where it became very popular in the 19th century and gave rise to numerous other games. Meanwhile All Fours itself has become the national game of Trinidad, where it is sometimes known as All Foes, and it continues to be played in England, in Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nAll Fours in Trinidad\nWith thanks to Glen Benjamin for explaining the modern Trinidad game to me.\nPlayers, cards and objective\nNormally there are four players, in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other. It is also possible, but less usual, for two people to play. \nA standard 52 card pack is used. In each suit, the cards rank from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nThe object of the game is to score points by winning tricks with valuable cards in them. The player or team that takes more valuable cards in tricks will score one point for "game". In addition, there are points for taking the jack of trumps in a trick, and for the holders of the highest and lowest trumps dealt. It is also possible for the dealer\'s team to score points for the card turned up for trumps during the deal.\nDeal\nPlayers cut for the deal, and whoever cuts the highest card becomes the first dealer. Deal and play are anticlockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the right after each hand. Each player is dealt six cards. The dealer can choose whether to deal the cards one at a time or in batches of three, but having chosen must stick to the same method for the whole game.\nWhen everyone has six cards, the dealer turns the next card face up to indicate the trump suit. If this turned up card is an ace, six or jack, the dealer\'s team immediately scores for it as follows:\n\nAce turned up . . . 1 point\nSix turned up . . . 2 points\nJack turned up . . . 3 points\n\nIf the player on the dealer\'s right is happy with the trump suit that is shown by the turn up, he says "Stand" and play begins. If the player on the dealer\'s right would prefer a different trump suit, he says, "I beg". The dealer then has the option to change trumps or to keep the suit of the turned up card as trumps. \nIf the dealer decides to keep the trumps as turned up, he says, "Take one"; the opponents of the dealer receive one point and play begins. \nIf the dealer agrees to change the trump suit, he sets aside the turned up card, deals three more cards to each player, and then turns up the next card to determine the trump suit, scoring for it as above if it is an ace, jack or six. \n\nIf this new turn up is of a different suit than the first turn up, play begins with this new suit as trumps. \nIf the new turn up is the same suit as before, the dealer gives another three cards to each player and turns up another card, scoring again if it is an ace, jack or six. This procedure is repeated until the turn up produces a new trump suit. \nIf the deck is exhausted before a new trump suit is found, the entire deck is reshuffled and redealt. The dealer\'s team nevertheless keeps any points they have scored for turned up cards.\n\nPlay\nThe player on the dealer\'s right has the first lead, and the winner of the trick leads to the next trick. Any card can be led, but the other players are subject to the following rules:\n\nIf a trump is led, the other players must play a trump if they can; anyone who has no trumps left can play any card.\nIf a card of a non-trump suit is led, then any player who has a card of that suit must either follow suit, by playing a card of the suit led, or play a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led can play any card (there is no obligation to play a trump in this case).\n\nThe trick is won by the highest trump card played to it; if no trumps are played it is won by the highest card of the suit led. \n\nNote that the effect of these rules is that is is always legal to play a trump. The only play that is prohibited is to throw a non-trump card of a different suit from the lead when you could have followed suit. That would be a revoke or renege, and is penalised as explained below.\nPlay continues until all players have played all their cards. If the original trump suit was accepted there will be six tricks, but if a change of trump suit was begged for and allowed, the players will have larger hands and there will be 9 or 12 tricks, or possibly even more in a two-player game.\nScoring\nAt the end of the play, points are scored for the cards that were dealt or taken in tricks. The points are as follows:\n\nHigh1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who had the highest trump.\nLow1 pointThis point is won by the team of the player who held the lowest trump that was dealt. It does not matter who wins the trick containing this trump - the point is for the original holders.\nJack1 or 3 pointsIf the jack of trumps wins a trick, or is won in a trick by the partner of the holder, the team with the jacks scores 1 point. If the jack is captured in a trick won by the opponents of the holder, the team capturing the jack scores 3 points for hang jack. If the jack of trumps was not dealt, then of course neither team scores for it.\nGame1 pointThis point goes to the team that wins the more valuable cards in tricks. For this purpose only, the top five cards in each suit have the following values: ace = 4, king = 3, queen = 2, jack = 1, ten = 10; other cards (2-9) have no value. Each team adds up the total value of the cards in their tricks, and whichever team has more scores the game point. If both teams have the same value of cards, no one gets the game point.\n\nEach team keeps a cumulative total of points they have won, and the first team to reach a total of 14 or more points over however many hands it takes wins the overall game. When nearing the end of a game, the points are counted strictly in the order high, low, jack, game to determine who has reached 14 first, so a tie is impossible. For example, suppose that at the start of a hand both teams have 13 points, that no points are scored for the turned up trump, and the trump suit is accepted. If team A has the highest trump, but team B win low, jack and game, then team A will win, because their point for high takes them to 14 before the other team can score.\nIrregularities\n\nMisdeal\nIf the dealer gives the wrong number of cards to the players, the opponents score one point for a misdeal, and the cards must be thrown in and shuffled and dealt again.\nRevoking - also called Reneging\nThis is playing a card of a non-trump card of a different suit from the card that was led when you could have followed suit. There is no penalty provided that the error is corrected by the player of the incorrect card before the end of the trick. An opposing player who notices the error may call the revoke at any time up to the end of the hand, and in that case the penalty is as follows. \n\nIf the player failed to follow a trump lead with trumps when they held one or more of the top five trumps, that player\'s team loses the whole of the game (14 points) currently in progress and a new game is started. \nIn other cases - a revoke on a non-trump lead or a failure to play a small trump on a trump lead - the opponents of the revoking player are awarded one point as a penalty, and the revoking team cannot win the point for game.\n\nCalling\nIf a player exposes a card other than in normal play, it must be left face up on the table. The opponents can then "call" for this card to be played on any subsequent trick, provided that playing it will not cause a revoke. \n\nVariations\nIn Tobago, it is the two rather than the six which scores two points when turned up.\nSome play that a player who has no trumps is forced to beg.\nSome play that "undertrumping" is not allowed. That is: if a non-trump suit is led and trumped, a later player is not allowed to play a lower trump unless he has no option.\nOther Trinidad All Fours web pages\nAs you might expect, Trinidad All Fours is also played in other places where there are people with a Trinidadian cultural background. For example, here is the web site of the Manitoba All Fours Association, in Canada.\nTrinidad All Fours software and on line games\nYou can obtain a Trinidad All Fours program at All Fours Online, which can be used to play against the computer or against an opponent on line. An online mobile phone version is also available.\nYou can play four-player Trinidad All Fours on line against live opponents at www.ttafo.com.\nWest Yorkshire All Fours\nAll Fours remains popular in parts of northern England. It is played in West Yorkshire pubs informally and on a league basis. Also Arthur Taylor, in his book of Pub Games reports a slightly different version played around Blackburn, Lancashire. I will describe the West Yorkshire version first, based on games played in 2003 in the Black Labrador pub, Batley, which belongs to the Heckmondwike league. I would like to thank the landlord John Dunning and his wife Anita for their help and hospitality.\nThere are four players in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. A standard 52 card pack is used, with the ace high and two low as usual. To begin the game, any player shuffles the cards, offers them to be cut by the player to the right, and deals the cards one at a time face up clockwise beginning with the player to their left until a jack appears.  The player who received the jack will pitch first, and the player to the right of the pitcher will deal the first hand.\nDeal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.  The dealer shuffles all the cards, and must offer them to the opponent to the right to cut.  The opponent may cut the cards or leave them as they are. The dealer deals six cards to each player, clockwise, in three rounds.  The number of cards dealt to each player in each round is at the choice of the dealer, for example all the cards may be dealt two at a time, or the dealer could deal one round three cards at a time, then one round two cards at a time and finish with a round of single cards.\nNo card is turned up for trumps. Instead, the pitcher (the player to dealer\'s left) leads (or "pitches") any card and the suit of that card is trumps for the hand. The pitcher\'s partner must not look at his or her cards until after the pitcher has led. This is to avoid any suspicion that the pitcher\'s partner might signal to the pitcher what suit to lead. (The penalty if the pitcher\'s partner breaks this rule is 4 points to the other team.)\nThe rules of play are the same as in Trinidad. A player who has a card of the suit led must either follow suit or trump. A player with no card of the suit led can play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump, or if it contains none, by the highest card of the suit led, and the winner leads to the next trick.\nThe first trick is stacked face up in front of one member of the team that won it, with a trump on top, to indicate the trump suit. Subsequent tricks are stored face down in front of one member of the winning team, in the usual way.\nIf you have no trumps and no valuable cards left (nothing higher than a nine), and you are not winning the current trick, you are allowed to indicate to your partner that your remaining cards are useless by throwing in your hand.  This is normally done by playing all your cards together, face up to the current trick.  You then take no further part in the play, and your partner continues alone.\nWhen the six tricks have been played, points are awarded in order as follows.\n\nHigh: the team that has the highest trump pegs one point.\nLow: the team that was dealt the lowest trump scores one point.\nJack: the team that wins the trick containing the jack of trumps scores one point. If the Jack was not dealt, this point is not awarded.\nGame: the team whose tricks have the highest total value of cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 in all four suits as usual, score one point. In the unusual case where both teams have exactly the same total value of cards in their tricks, neither team scores the point for game.\n\n\n\nThe points are pegged on a special wooden peg board, and the first team to reach 11 points wins. In the event that both teams are close to winning, the points are always pegged in the order high, low, jack, game.  So, for example, if the score is 10-10 the team holding the highest trump will win the match, even if the other team would have won the other three points.\nWhen playing for money, it is usual to agree a stake for winning the match, and an additional stake for winning all four points in one hand.  For example, if playing 2 pounds and 1 pound, if team A scores all four twice and wins the match, while team B scores all four once, each member of team A would receive 3 pounds (2+1+1-1) and each member of team B would pay 3 pounds.\nWhen there is a payment for \'all four\', the play of the last hand of a match must be continued as long as there is a chance of \'all four\' being made, even if the result of the match is already settled.  (For example, a team with 10 points pitches the ace of trumps, winning the match, but can continue playing to try to make all four on the hand, but if an opponent has the trump 2, play can end, since there is nothing more at stake.)\nTactics\nThe choice of pitch is of great importance.  Since this first card fixes the trump suit, it determines who will win two of the four possible points: high and low.  A short suit containing the ace is preferable to a longer suit of intermediate cards; a suit containing the ace and two, for two sure points, is ideal.  The jack may yield a point if protected by other cards in the same suit, but it would be better to pitch a bare ace or even a two for a sure point than (say) the eight from J-8 for a possible point if your jack is not caught.  However, a jack in a three-card suit can usually be saved, so for example J-9-2 would be a better suit to pitch from than A-6.  Lacking aces, it may be worth choosing a suit headed by a king or even a queen.  Since only 24 of the 52 cards are dealt out, your king or queen could score the high point if no one has the top card(s) of the suit.\nIn the play, do not be too concerned with winning tricks, unless they are of some value.  Rather than win a cheap trick it is often better to leave an opponent \'in\' (i.e. with the lead), so that your side will play last to the next trick.\nThe most important objective of the play is to catch or save the jack of trumps, if it has been dealt.  If you have one of the top three trumps, and suspect the opponents may have the jack, it is worth saving your top card until you can catch the jack.\nAs far as the game point is concerned, the most important cards are the tens, which account for half the value of the pack, but are difficult to save since they are only the fifth highest cards of their suits.  If your partner is winning a trick in a suit which you are \'off\' (have no cards in), don\'t neglect to throw a ten of another suit into the trick if you have one.  When playing second to a trick, it is sometimes worth playing a ten in the hope that partner can win the trick.  Sometimes a player will \'push\' with a ten - offer it in the hope that the opponents will use a high trump to capture it.  A simple example would be to trump with the 10 holding J-10 in the hope that an opponent with a top trump would use it to catch the 10 and let you save your jack.\nAs in any game it is important to pay attention to the fall of the cards.  You cannot accurately count the suits, since over half the cards are undealt, but there are many inferences from the cards that are played or not played.  To begin with, anyone who does not play a trump to the first trick is off trumps, so their right-hand opponent can win tricks efficiently with small trumps or top cards of other suits.  Ideally you should be aware when players are off other suits, and also when any of your cards becomes a \'bobby\' - the highest outstanding card of its suit.\nTactics are affected to some extent by the score in the match.  If you are a long way behind it is worth taking risks to catch up; if you are ahead you should play safe.\nVariations\nWhen partnerships are not arranged in advance, at the start of the game cards are dealt around face up until all four jacks have appeared (a player who has received a jack is dealt no more cards). The people with the two red jacks are partners against those with the black jacks. The same procedure can be used when there are more than four people wishing to play. The four who received the jacks play and the others wait for a future opportunity to join in.\nSome cut to decide first pitch - highest card pitches first.\nIn some places \'trumping in\' is not allowed.  In these places you are only allowed to play a trump if a trump is led, or if you are unable to follow suit to a non-trump lead. One correspondent told me that the (original) version of the rules, in which a trump can be played at any time, is known as \'Batley Carr Rules\' or \'Scarborough Rules\'. Another tells me that trumping in is allowed in Holmfirth, but 3 miles away in Honley it is not.\nIt is possible for six people to play, in three teams of two, or two people to play against each other. The rules of play and scoring are exactly the same is for four players; the two-player game is played to 9 points and the six-player game to 11 points.\nIn the Heckmondwike league, when two pubs compete, each pub fields eight players, and they play four simultaneous matches to 15 points.  The winners of each score two match points and another two match points are scored by the pub with the higher total game point score over the four tables.  There is no bonus for "all four" in the league version.\nLancashire All Fours\nAccording to Arthur Taylor\'s book of Pub Games (St Albans, 1976; Guinness, 1992), All Fours is played in Blackburn in casual games and in several leagues. Rules are similar to the Yorkshire version described above, with a few differences.\n\nTo begin the game the cards are cut for first pitch. A player of one team cuts and a player of the other team must guess whether the cut card is red or black: if the guesser is right, the guesser\'s team selects a player to pitch first; if not, a player of the cutting team pitches first.The point for Low goes to the team that wins the trick containing the lowest trump dealt, not the original holder of the card, as in other versions.\nArthur Taylor does not mention that the first trick is stored face up, nor that a player without trumps or counting cards can throw their hand in. The natural assumption would therefore be that all tricks are stored face down, and that all players keep playing to the last trick, even if they have no useful cards left.\n\n17th Century English All-Fours\nThe earliest description of All Fours that I know of was published in Charles Cotton\'s "Compleat Gamester" (1674). According to this account, the game was much played in Kent, and originated in that county. It was a game for two players, using the 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen by cutting cards - whoever cuts the highest "Put-card" deals. [This apparently means that when cutting for deal, the cards rank from high to low 3-2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4 as in the contemporary game of Put. For all other purposes, however, the cards rank A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2 as usual. It is not mentioned, but presumably the dealer shuffles and the dealer\'s opponent cuts before the deal. Presumably the turn to deal alternates between the players.]\nThe dealer deals six cards to each player in batches of three and turns up the next card, the 13th, to show the proposed trump suit, scoring one point if it is a jack. The dealer\'s opponent can either accept the trump suit or beg one. If the non-dealer begs, the dealer must either allow the non-dealer to score one point and throw in the cards, or deal another three cards each and turn another card for trumps, repeating this until a different suit is turned. [It is unclear how the point for a turned up jack is treated if the trump suit is changed. It could either be like the modern Trinidad game, in which all turned jacks are scored, or like the 19th century American game, in which only the jack of the final trump suit can be scored.]\nThe non-dealer leads to the first trick and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The higher trump wins, or if no trump is played, the higher card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nWhen all the cards have been played, points are scored in order as follows:\n\nHighest: one point for the holder of the highest trump dealt.\nLowest: one point for the original holder of the lowest trump dealt.\nJack: one point for a player who wins a trick containing the jack of trumps.\nGame: one point for the player whose tricks contain the higher value in cards, counting ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, ten=10 as usual.\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the agreed target score, which can be from 7 to 15, but is most commonly set at 11.\n\nA variation called Running All-Fours is briefly described. This is played to a target score of 31 points, and the only other difference is that in the deal, the dealer scores 4 points if the turned up trump is an ace, 3 is it is a king, 2 if it is a queen or 1 if it is a jack.\nNorth American All Fours, Old Sledge or Seven Up\nTo judge from the literature, All Fours became very popular in North America in the 19th century. In the 20th century it was largely superseded by bidding variations such as Pitch and Pedro.\nIn American card game books of the early 19th century, All Fours is a two-player game, very similar to the 17th century English game described above. When cutting for deal the cards now rank in their normal order with ace high, and the deal can be one or three cards at a time at the dealer\'s choice. Many play that if the non-dealer begs and the dealer decides to change the trump suit, then after the necessary extra cards have been dealt, the players discard unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. The target score is 10 points.\nThe version of All Fours described by R.F.Foster in 1897 goes by the name of Old Sledge or Seven Up. It can be played by two or three players, each playing for themselves, or by four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The deal and play are clockwise and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The dealer deals six cards to each player, three at a time, and then turns up a card to show the proposed trump suit.\nThe player to dealer\'s left may beg, and dealer has the usual options.\n\nSay "Take it", and play with the proposed trump suit, allowing the opponent(s) to score one point for gift.  If there are three players, both opponents score, but if the opponent who did not beg needs only one point for game, he is not allowed to win in this way, so presumably the dealer is forced to run the cards in that case.\nChange the trump suit by running the cards. The dealer deals three more cards to each player and turns up another card; if it is the same suit as the first one, he repeats this until a new suit is turned up for trumps. If the deck is exhausted, the cards are bunched - the cards are thrown in, shuffled and redealt by the same dealer.\n\nAfter the cards have been run, any player who does not like the second trump suit can propose to bunch the cards. If all players agree there is a redeal by the same dealer, but anyone can insist on playing with the new trumps and no points are given for this.\n\nIf a jack is turned up for trump, the dealer (or dealer\'s team) scores one point for it, but if the cards are run, no point is scored for a jack turned up in the original turned suit, and no point is scored if the cards are bunched. The point is only scored if the turned up card that finally determines trumps is a jack.\nAfter the cards have been run and a new trump suit determined, all players discard face-down sufficient unwanted cards to reduce their hands to six cards. In some circles this was only done if the players had 12 or more cards, but if the cards were run only once, the players kept and played with their 9-card hands.\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads and the usual All Fours rules of play apply: players may trump at any time but can only throw a non-trump of a different suit from the lead if unable to follow suit. The highest trump wins, or if no trump is played, the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nThere are the usual four points: High, Low, Jack and Game, scored in that order, with the Low point going to the original holder of the card, not the player who wins it in a trick. In the event of a tie for Game in the two- or four-player game, the point goes to the opponent(s) of the dealer. This is meant to compensate to some extent for the dealer\'s advantage in being able to score a point if a jack is turned for trumps. In a three-player game, if the two non-dealers tie for the Game point no one gets it, but if the dealer ties with another player, the other player gets it.\nThe game is usually played to seven points. Each player or team starts with seven chips, and places one in the pool for each point they win; the winner is the first player or team to have placed all their chips in the pool.\nFoster describes a variation called Blind All Fours or Pitch in which no card is turned for trumps and there is no begging or running of the cards. In this game the first card pitched by the player to dealer\'s left fixes the trump suit (as in Lancashire All Fours). In this game, when the Game point is tied no one gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > All Fours Group > All Fours\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2003, 2007.

Muggins and Sniff are played more often in Britain and Europe, while All Fives and Five Up are played in the United States.\nIn Muggins, dominoes are played as usual so that the touching ends match in number. Players score for making the two ends of the layout add up to a multiple of five, and also whoever runs out of dominoes scores for those remaining in the other players\' hands.\nEquipment\nThe game uses a standard set of Western double-six dominoes - 28 tiles in all.  The game can be played by two to four players.  A cribbage board is useful for scoring, since scores are totaled as they are made and not at the end of the hand. Alternatively the score can be kept using pencil and paper.\nThe Deal\nThe size of the hand varies with the number of players:\n\n\n2 players get 7 tiles each\n3 players get 5 tiles each\n4 players get 5 tiles each\n\nThe rest of the tiles form the boneyard.\nThe Play\nThe first player in the first hand is determined by lot.  In the following hands, the player who won or dominoed in the previous hand plays first.  If the last hand was blocked, then the lead is again determined by lot.  The lead can be any tile in the player\'s hand.\nThe next players must match the ends of the tiles on the table in the usual manner.  Doubles are turned crosswise and count as the total of their pips for scoring purposes if they are at one end of the layout.\nAll doubles are turned crosswise, but are not played as spinners.  If a player cannot play a tile, he must draw tiles from the boneyard until he has a tile which will play or the boneyard is empty.  When he draws a tile which will play, it goes on the table immediately and his turn ends.  If he empties the boneyard and still cannot play, he passes and the next player takes his turn.\nThe hand continues until one player dominoes or until all players are blocked.\nScoring\nAfter a player has set a tile on the tableau, the two open ends of the layout are totaled.  If this total is a multiple of five (5, 10, 15, or 20 points), the player immediately scores that number of points.  The turned doubles on the end of the layout score the totals of their pips; that is [5-5] counts ten points, [6-6] counts twelve point and so forth. \nWhen the hand is finished, either by being dominoed or by being blocked, the pips on the tiles remaining in each hand are totaled and the total is rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of five.  For example, a hand with [1-2] would round up to five points, while [1-1] would round down to zero points.  These points are then subtracted from that player\'s score.\nThe game is played for 200 points with three or four players and for 250 points with two players.  With four players, you can make two partnerships and play for 250 points.  Pen and paper are probably the most common scoring device.\nIf you use a cribbage board for scoring, then one player should be designated as the scorekeeper.  Each player should announce the total of the two ends of the tableau at the end of their turn so that the scorekeeper can peg it.  Each hole counts five points, so a single trip up the side of a cribbage board is 300 points, so a player wins when his peg gets to the last group of five holes on the broad.\nThe abacus style scoring device used in the Fives Family (see the section on equipment) is operated by one player for his own score.  The abacus has five columns of ten beads each.  Each bead counts five points, so when all 50 beads have been moved from one side of the frame to the other, the player has scored 250 points.\nComments & Strategy\nMuggins is a good, quick two player game.\nThe highest score in one play is 20 points, which is obtained by having the [6-6] tile on one end and the [4-4] tile on the other.  However, you will find that when the [6-6] is exposed, you can often get 15 points by setting a tile that makes the other end a 3.\nVariations\nThere are several variations on this game in the literature.  The most common changes are a different number of tiles per hand and the additional rule that the boneyard is considered empty when it has two tiles left.\nSome play Muggins as a block game - the tiles in the boneyard (the sleepers) are not drawn - a player unable to play simply passes.\nSome score 1 point for each 5 contained in the total of the layout ends (so 2 for 10, 3 for 15, 4 for 20) and give 1 point to a player who dominoes or "chips out" by playing his last tile. Alternatively, in the version, the total pips on the other players\' remaining tiles may be rounded to the nearest five and the result divided by five:  each loses that number of points. Another possibility is that the player who has most pips remaining rounds this number to the nearest five and divides by five, and the winner scores this number - for example 3 points if the player with most unplayed pips had 13 pips. \nThere are some major rule variations which really give new games.\n\nAll Threes\nThis is the same game as Muggins, but using multiples of three rather than multiples of five, and scoring 1 point for each multiple of three. So the maximum score for a play is 6 points, when the total of the ends is 18 (for example a 6-6 at one end and a 6 at the other or a 5-5 at one end and a 4-4 at the other). The player who runs out of dominoes scores an extra point for this - or alternatively scores one third the number of pips held by the player with most pips unplayed, rounded to the nearest whole number.\nFives and Threes\nThis is a similar game, popular in Britain, in which a player scores points not only for making a multiple of 5, but also for making a multiple of 3.      \nSniff\nFredrick Berndt (THE DOMINO BOOK; Bantam Books; ISBN 0-84-07601-4; 1975) gives a version of Muggins under the name Sniff.  There are other games with the name Sniff in the Fives Family, so this can be confusing. \n    The sniff is the first domino played and it can be set either in line or turned.  If it is played in line, then only one end is counted in the total.  If it is turned, then both ends are counted in the total in the usual manner.  For example, assume that the table has [6-1][1-4] on it as the tableau.  The [4-4] can be turned and the total will be (6 + 4 + 4) 14 points, or it can be played in line and the total will be 10 points.  Once the sniff is played, the game is just like Muggins. \n\nOther Muggins web pages\n\nRules of Muggins can be found on the Domino Plaza site.\n\nSoftware and online games\nMike Perry\'s Allgood Software publishes a Dominoes program for the Macintosh, which plays a wide variety of domino games, including Muggins and All Fives.\n\nRubl.com offers a two-player online domino muggins game for prizes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Western Domino Games > Muggins\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net) and is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       Joe Celko, John McLeod 2003, 2006, 2011.

The object is to win more tricks than any other individual player, or in case of equality to be the first to have won them; the team of the player who achieves this wins the point. Thierry Depaulis has provided the following historical introduction.\nAluette (or la Vache, "The Cow Game") is played in Vende and the coasts of Brittany, using a 48 card Spanish suited pack with special designs. Aluette is a very peculiar trick-taking game where suits are irrelevant. Partners can use gestures to signal what cards they hold. The play mechanism is similar to that of early games like Truc / Trut and Put, and it cannot be a coincidence that 3\'s, 2\'s and aces are high cards in all these games. The use of Spanish suited cards is surprising, but there is a theory that these suits were originally used throughout France and were displaced in most of the country by  French suits when those were invented in the 15th century. Aluette may be an extremely old game: some late 15th-century records from the South-West of France mention a card game called Luettes. However, it is clear that Nantes is the modern cradle of the game, and until about 1700 there was in Nantes a large group of Spanish merchants, and Spanish suited cards made in Thiers (Auvergne) were conveyed on the Loire river up to Nantes where they were shipped to Bilbao and Navarra. Therefore a late introduction, perhaps in the 17th century, through Spanish merchants in Nantes is also possible.\nPlayers and Cards\nThere are four players in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other. Deal and play are clockwise.\nThe 48-card pack consists of king (roi), knight (cavalire), jack (valet), 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, ace (as) in each of the four suits coins, cups, batons and swords. Some of the important cards have pictures corresponding to their nicknames. The ranking from high to low is:\n\nThree of Coins (monsieur)\nThree of Cups (madame)\nTwo of Coins (le borgne) - the blind man\nTwo of Cups (la vache) - the cow\nNine of Cups (grand-neuf)\nNine of Coins (petit-neuf)\nTwo of Batons (deux de chne) - two of oak\nTwo of Swords (deux d\'crit) - two of writing\nThe four Aces \nThe four Kings\nThe four Cavalires \nThe four Jacks \nThe Nines of Swords and Batons\nThe four Eights\nThe four Sevens\nThe four Sixes\nThe four Fives\nThe four Fours\nThe Threes of Swords and Batons\n\nNote that apart from the highest eight cards, the cards come in groups of two or four of equal rank. \nIn North America, the special cards used for Aluette  can be obtained from TaroBear\'s Lair.\nDeal and Chant\nTo choose the teams and the first dealer, any player deals the cards one at a time face up to the players until the highest four cards have appeared. A player who has received one of these cards is dealt no further cards. The players who receive "monsieur" and "madame" are partners against the players who receive "le borgne" and "la vache". "Madame" is the first to deal, and thereafter the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nThe dealer shuffles and the player to dealer\'s right cuts. Then the dealer deals nine cards to each player in batches of three, and checks that there are twelve cards left over.\nIf all four players agree, the twelve remaining cards are dealt one at a time alternately to the player to dealer\'s left and the dealer, so that each has six extra cards. These two players then each select six cards to discard face down, to reduce their hands to nine cards - naturally they will each discard the lowest six cards in their hands. This process is known as chanter (singing). If any player objects, there is no singing: all players play with the nine cards they were originally dealt, and the last twelve cards remain unused and unseen until the end of the play.\nPlay\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads to the first trick, and the other players in turn each play a card. There is no restriction on which cards can be played. Whoever played the highest card wins the trick, stacks it face down in front of him or her, and leads any card to the next trick. This continues until all nine tricks have been played.\nSince some of the cards are equal in rank, it quite often happens that there is a tie for highest card played to the trick. In this case the trick is "spoiled" (pourri) and no one wins it. The player who led to the spoiled trick leads again to the next trick.\nWith a little experience, it becomes clear that there is a big advantage in playing last to a trick - one can wait and "voir venir" (see what comes). In most cases, at least for the first few tricks, the first two players should play low cards. The third player should play a high card to stop the fourth player winning the trick cheaply, and the fourth player will try to beat this card as economically as possible. Alternatively, the fourth player may throw a low card, sacrificing the trick but putting partner in last position for the following trick. It is often a good idea to for the fourth player to spoil the trick if possible by equalling the third player\'s card, thus keeping the advantage of playing last without giving the trick to an opponent. Of course players are free to depart from this pattern if the see a tactical advantage in doing so.\nScoring\nWhen all nine tricks have been played, the team of the individual player who has taken most tricks wins 1 point. If, as often happens, two or more players tie for most tricks, the point goes to the first player who achieved that number of tricks. In order to remember who this was, it is customary for the first player who wins a seciond trick to turn one of its cards face up, and the first player who wins a third trick to turn two of its cards face up.\nA game consists of five deals - so the player who dealt the first hand also deals the last - and the team that wins more points wins the match.\nIn order to make the game more interesting, many play that a player who wins by taking a series of consecutive tricks at the end, having previously won no tricks, scores two point rather than one for the team. This feat is called mordienne. If your partner is trying to make mordienne you can help by spoiling as many tricks as possible, trying to distribute tricks evenly between the opponents, and  overtaking or spoiling any trick that your partner is in danger of winning during the first five tricks.\nA team that considers that they have little or no chance of winning a deal can offer to surrender, to save time and to avoid the danger of mordienne. If the opponents accept the surrender, they score one point without play. If the opponents refuse the surrender they are committing themselves to win mordienne: if they succeed they score the usual 2 points; if they don\'t make mordienne the team that tried to surrender scores 2 points.\nExamples: North and South are partners against East and West. The letters indicate who wins each trick, and \'X\' is a spoiled trick.\n\nSENWSEXNW. South wins 1 point for North-South. When the high cards are evenly distributed, the tricks often tend to be won in rotation like this, each trick being won by the last player. By spoiling the 7th trick North engineered a situation where everyone has two tricks, but South wins by having been the first to achieve this.\nSENWENWNW. North wins 1 point for North-South by being the first individual player to get three tricks, even though the other team took more tricks in total.\nSXENXSWWW. West wins 2 points for East-West (mordienne).\nXSENXWSSS. This is just an ordinary 1-point win for N-S. It is not mordienne because South won the second trick as well as the last three.\nEXWEWNNNX. 1-point to North-South. This looks like a failed attempt at mordienne by North.\n\nAccording to one account of the game (Guy Rebour: La Crapette et le Jeu de Aluette), much copied by other writers, mordienne can be announced before the lead to the first trick. Rebour states that if this happens the match is extended: it continues for as many deals as necessary until a team wins by achieving a score of at least 10 points. This is somewhat hard to understand. It is difficult to see why one would want to give away one\'s intention to play for mordienne by announcing it rather than playing it silently, and it is surprising that this should alter the winning condition for the match so dramatically. A match to 10 points would typically last about three times as long as a match of five deals. It may be that Rebour is in fact describing a separate variation here - one in which mordienne only scores if announced and the target is always 10 points.\nSignals\nPartners are allowed to communicate during the game by means of a fixed system of signals. Most of these are used to indicate that one holds a particular card. Signals can be used at any time during the play and even while picking up cards as they are being dealt. Naturally one tries to choose a time when one\'s partner is watching and one\'s opponents are not paying attention, and to make the signal as subtle as possible while getting the message across, to avoid detection by the enemy. \nI strongly recommend anyone learning to play Aluette first to play several matches without any signals, in order to get used to the cards and the tactics of the game. Only then can one judge when it might be worthwhile to signal a particular card. Beginners tend to signal far too much. There is no point in signalling a card unless your partner actually needs the information. In particular if one member of a partnership has a strong hand, there is little point in signalling cards to the weaker partner - you just risk alerting the opponents to your strength. On the other hand  it can be useful for the weaker partner to signal a good card that may complement the stronger player\'s holding.\n\n\nCard or message\nGesture\n\n\nMonsieur (3 of coins)\nRaise the eyes - look upwards\n\n\nMadame (3 of cups)\nBend the head to one side or raise one corner of the mouth\n\n\nLe borgne (2 of coins)\nClose one eye - wink\n\n\nLa vache (2 of cups)\nMime a "moo" - pout\n\n\nGrand-neuf (9 of cups)\nShow the thumb\n\n\nPetit-neuf (9 of coins)\nShow the little finger\n\n\nDeux de chne (2 of batons)\nShow the index and/or middle finger\n\n\nDeux d\'crit (2 of swords)\nShow the ring finger or mime writing\n\n\nAs (ace)\nOpen the mouth - for two aces open twice, etc.\n\n\nI have a  bad hand\nRaise the shoulders\n\n\nI will try for mordienne\nBite the lip\n\n\nOther Aluette web pages\n\n  Here is an archive copy of an Aluette page in French, with illustrations of some of the cards.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Put Group > Aluette\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1998, 2010.

Readers are assumed to be familiar with the rules of poker in general and of five-card stud and  seven-card stud in particular.\nPass the Trash\nThis variation is sometimes known as Anaconda. Also the name "Pass the Trash" is sometimes used for the game called Selection / Rejection on this page. There can be up to seven players.\nAfter the antes are placed, seven cards are dealt, face down, to each player. Players look at their cards and there is a betting round, begun by the player to dealer\'s left. \nNow each active player places three unwanted cards face down in front of them. When all are ready, each set of three cards is passed to the next active player to the left. Players look at the new cards they received and there is a second betting round.\nNow everyone discards two unwanted cards, choose an order for the other five cards and stacks them face down. Each player turns over the first card of their stack and there is a betting round, begun by the player with the highest hand showing. This is repeated until everyone has four cards face up and just one face down.\nAfter the final betting round the highest five-card hand wins the showdown.\nVariations\nThis game is often played high-low. Before the showdown everyone declares whether they will go for high, low or both, and the high and low winners split the pot.\nSome play with three phases of passing trash. In the first phase three cards are discarded and passed to the left; in the second phase two cards are passed two places to the left; and in the third phase one card is passed three places to the left. There is a betting round after each phase of passing.\nThe dealer (in a dealer\'s choice game) can specify other patterns of passing as desired.\nBecause cards are normally passed to the left, some play that the pot is split between the high hand and next active player to the right. The logic is that you should share in the success of the player to whom you passed cards.\n\nHowdy Doody\nThis is the same as Pass the Trash, played high/low, but with wild cards. Threes are wild in the hand of a player going for high and kings are wild for a player going for low. A player who calls both will need to win high with threes wild and low with kings wild.\n\nPush\nThis is a five-card stud game in which players can pay to reject an up-card dealt to them and take the next card from the deck instead. The price for doing this must be agreed in advance - for example 5 times the minimum bet. The game  can be played by 4 to 9 players and is best for 5 to 7. \nOne card (the hole card) is dealt face down to each player. Then the dealer offers a card face up to the player to his left. The player may either accept this card or pay the agreed price to the pot to "push" that card and receive be dealt the next card from the deck face up. This second card must be accepted.\nThe next player to the left is offered the card pushed by the previous player or, if that player accepted the free card, a new card face up from the deck. The player can accept the offered card free of charge, or pay to push that card and be dealt the next card face up. All the other players in  turn have a similar choice. If the last player pays to push, the pushed card is discarded face down. Now there is a betting round beginning with the player who has the highest card showing.\nThere is another round of pushing. The first card offered to the first active player to dealer\'s left is always a fresh card dealt face up from the deck. Other players are first offered the pushed card if the previous player pushed. When everyone has two face-up cards there is a second round of betting begun by the player with the highest hand showing.\nThere are two more rounds of pushing, each followed by a betting round. At the end, active players have five cards, four of which are face up. In the showdown the highest hand wins.\nVariations\nRoll your own. In this variant, all cards are dealt face down and pushing is free. The dealer deals a card face down to the first player to the left, and this player either accepts it or pushes it and must take the next card. If a card is pushed it is offered to the next player; otherwise the next player is offered the top card of the deck. Each player in turn either accepts the first card offered or pushes it and must take the next card from the deck. If the dealer pushes the pushed card is discarded face down. Now everyone has one hole card and there is a betting round.\nIn the next four rounds, cards dealt and pushed face down as in the first round, but each time a player acquires a new card, one of the player\'s two face down cards must turned face up. This each player always has one card in the hole and at the showdown has four face up cards. This variant can be played all-high, all-low or high/low with declaration.\nSubstitution. In this variant, after the betting round in which each player has five cards, the active players may pay to change one card. Each in turn, starting with the first active player to dealer\'s left, can pay a price agreed in advance (for example 10 times the minimum bet) to discard any one card and receive a new card from the deck face down in exchange. Either the hole card or an up-card can be discarded: if an upcard is discarded the player will have only three cards showing after the exchange. There is a final round of betting and a showdown.\nSelection / Rejection\nThis seven-card stud poker variant for up to 7 players is sometimes known as Want it? Want it? Got it! or occasionally as Polish.\nThe players place an ante and two cards are dealt face down to each player. In each subsequent round of dealing there is a "leader": first it is  the player to dealer\'s left and in each subsequent round of dealing the position of leader moves to the next active player to the left.\nThe dealer offers the top card of the deck face up to the leader. The leader can accept it or reject it. If it is rejected it is offered to the next player to the left and if this player also rejects it the third player must take it. Then the next card is offered face up to the next player in turn - i.e. the player to the left of the one who took the previous card - who may accept it or reject it. Each card can be rejected at most twice: the third player must accept it. When offering cards around the table, players who have already acquired a card in that dealing round are skipped. When everyone has a card there is a betting round. As usual in stud poker, all betting rounds are begun by the player with the best card or hand showing.\nThis process is repeated three more times, so that everyone has four up-cards. After the ensuing betting round, a seventh card is dealt to each player face down. There is a final betting round followed by declaration of high, low or both and a showdown.\n\nDo Ya\nThis is a five-card stud game in which players have a choice of three cards for each of their up-cards.\nAfter the antes are placed, the dealer deals one card face down to each player. Each player\'s hole card is wild for that player only.\nThe dealer now deals a card face up and offers it to the first player to dealer\'s left, traditionally saying "do ya?". The player can accept or reject the card. If it is rejected the dealer offers a second card similarly. If that too is rejected the dealer deals a third card face up, which the player must accept. \nThere will now be zero, one or two rejected cards face up on the table. The next player to the left has a choice of these rejects. If none of them is accepted the dealer deals further cards face up one at a time, but again at most two cards cane be rejected and then the third must be accepted. So for example if the previous player rejected two cards and the next player does not want them either, this player must accept the next card from the deck and the same two rejects will be offered to as the first two cards to the following player.\nWhen everyone has acquired a card, any cards rejected by the last player (dealer) are discarded face down and there is a betting round. All betting rounds are begun by the player with the best card or hand showing.\nThe process of offering, accepting and rejecting cards is repeated three more times, so that everyone has four cards face up and one (wild) face down hole card. After the final betting round there is a showdown and the high hand wins the pot.\nIt is also possible, though unusual, to play this game high/low.\nHave a Heart  \nThis is a seven-card stud variant in which hearts have a special effect. The deal is exactly as in seven card stud: two cards face down and one face up to each player; betting round; three more cards face up to each player, each followed by a betting round;  one card each face down; betting round; showdown in which the high hand wins.\nThe difference is that whenever a heart is dealt face up, the player who gets it takes one card of his or her choice from any other player. A face up card can be taken and it remains face up or a face down card can be taken unseen from another player\'s hole cards. If a face down card is taken, the player taking it looks at it after selecting it and keeps it face down as an extra hole card.\nPlayers whose cards are taken do not draw replacements, so it is possible for a player to finish with fewer than five cards. In this case the rules for comparing incomplete hands are used in the showdown.\nVariation. Alternatively, you can play that the player who takes a card must give the player a card in exchange: a face up card for a face up card or a face down card for a face down card. The player with the heart chooses what card to give back. It is even possible to give back the same card, for example if a hole card is taken and proves to be of no use.\nBuddha\'s Folly\nThis game is played with match pot betting, as in Guts.\nThe players ante and the dealer deals five cards face down to each player. The players look at their cards.\nNow the dealer turns the next card of the deck face up and offers it to the player to his or her left. This player may either\n\naccept the card, add it to his or her hand, and discard one card face up in exchange which is offered to the next player to the left, or\nreject the card offered and pass it on to the next player to the left.\n\nThe next player then has the same options: accept or reject the offered card. This continues around the table, possibly for several circuits, until some card is rejected by every player and comes back to the player who originally discvarded or rejected it.\nNow all players declare whether they are in or out - this can be done simultaneously or in sequence as agreed in advance or specified in advance by the dealer. The players who stay in show their hands. The best five-card poker hand wins the pot, and any other players who stayed in must pay an amount equal to what was in the pot to be played for in the next deal.\nIf playing with simultaneous declaration, some play that if everyone tries to drop out, the players show their hands and the player with the best hand must pay all the antes for the next deal.\nTrees\nAfter the antes have been placed, five cards are dealt face down to each player, and there is a round \nof betting.\nActive players can then trade cards freely. The Game Report, which described this variant, specified that a player must give the same number of cards that he receives, but did not explain exactly how the trades are done. I suggest that after two players have agreed how many cards they wish to exchange, each should simultaneously select that number of cards from  hand and put them on the table face down; then the cards are exchanged between them without showing them to the other players. \nTrades continue until no more trades can be agreed. Then there is a final round of betting followed by a showdown, which is won by the highest hand.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Pass The Trash\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2011.

It is a rare example of a card game of almost pure skill, the skills required being accurate observation and quick reactions.\nSnap seems to have first appeared towards the end of the 19th century, perhaps originating as a simplified but in some ways more exciting version of Snip Snap Snorum. \nPlayers and Cards\nSnap is suitable for from two to about six players: with more than six it becomes unwieldy. A standard 52-card pack is used. Suits do not matter, only the ranks A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K. Some people prefer to play with special cards: any pack consiting of a reasonable number of sets of identical or matching cards is suitable. Various designs of Snap cards are available from amazon.com:\n\n\n\n\n\nDeal and Play\nAnyone may deal. The cards are shuffled and dealt out to the players as equally as possible. Players do not look at their cards but keep them in a face down stack in front of them.\n The player to dealer\'s left begins and the turn to play passes clockwise. At your turn you simply turn the top card of your face-down pile and place it face-up alongside. In this way each player forms a pile of face-up cards beside their face-down pile.  If at any moment two of the face-up piles have matching cards at the top (for example two sixes or two kings), anyone who notices this shouts "snap!". The first person who shouted "snap!" takes both matching face-up piles and adds them face-down to the bottom of their face-down pile. The game then continues as before, beginning with the player to the left of the last one who turned a card.\nIf you have no face-down cards left when it comes to your turn, you simply turn over your face-up pile to make a new face-down pile and turn over the top card as before. If you have no cards left at all, you are out of the game. The last player in is the winner.\nWhen turning up cards, you are not allowed to peek at your card before the other players can see it. To ensure this, cards should be turned over facing away from the player, so that if it is turned too slowly the turning player will see it last.\nIf a player shouts "snap" in error, when there is no match, that player\'s face-up pile is taken away and put in the centre of the table, where it becoms a snap pool. If this happens several times there can be several snap pools. If the top card of any player\'s pile matches the top card of one of the snap pools, the first player who calls "snap pool" takes both piles.    \nVariations\n\nSingle Pile\nVery young children may play a version where players turn over their cards onto a single pile in the centre of the table. In this version, when two consecutive cards match, any player who notices this may call "snap" and the first player who calls wins the centre pile and adds it to their own cards face down. A player who calls "snap" incorrectly must give the top card of their pile, face down, to the player of the card for which they wrongly called "snap". As usual, players who tun out of cards drop out of the game and the last player holding cards is the winner.\nIf two or more players call "snap" simultaneously, the central pile is moved aside to become a  "snap pool". Subsequently, if the top card of the centre pile matches a snap pool, the first player who calls "snap pool" wins the snap pool pile.\nSimultaneous calls\nSome play that if  two or more players shout snap at exactly the same time, the matching piles are combined into a single pile, which forms an additional  snap pool, placed in the centre of the table. If two or more people call "snap pool" at the same time, the player pile that matches the snap pool in question is added to it. \nAlternatively, problems with simultaneous calls can be solved by having an object in the middle of the table, which is to be grabbed by anyone calling snap. If several people try to put their hands on the object. the one whose hand is underneath, inm contact with the object, is clearly the first.\nIn single pile snap, the players may be required to slap the centre pile when calling snap. When several do this, the player whose hand is underneath gets the pile. The game then becomes rather similar to Slap Jack. \nOnly owners of equal cards may snap\nIn the game in which each player has their own pile, some play that only the owners of the matching cards are allowed to call snap, and the first to do so wins both piles.\n\nAnimals\nIn this variant of Snap, which is suitable for about four to eight players, each player chooses a different animal at the start of the game. The dealer deals the cards to the players face up, one card to each player in turn, forming a face up pile in front of each player.  When the top cards of two piles match, the owners of those two piles  must call the name of the other player\'s animal. The first to do so correctly wins the other player\'s pile and places it under their own. The winner is the player who has most cards when the deck runs out.\nSome play this with animal noises rather than animals. Some play that when claiming a match you have to say the name of the noise made by the other player\'s animal, rather than making the noise. For example if your pile matches the cat\'s pile, you have to say the word "meow", not making a meowing sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > War group > Snap\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2013.

They are all four-player descendants of the French point-trick game  Mariage played with 32 or 24  cards, in which the bidder chooses a partner by calling a card. They all use a simplified system of card values in which the  aces, the tens and the last trick count 10 points. The King and Queen of a suit together in one hand (or the King and Over when German suited cards are used) can be declared for an extra  40 points in trumps and 20 in other suits. These games are closely related to the Czech game Mari, and more distantly to Austrian Bauernschnapsen. \nThe calling of a card to choose a partner is reflected in the names of the games, all based on the German word rufen - to call. Anrufen just means calling and Rufmariasch refers also to the French ancestor mariage. The name Knigrufen (call the king), used in some places in Austria, is at first sight surprising, because it is normally Aces, not Kings, that are called in this game. The name was perhaps transferred from a popular Austrian variant of Tarock, also called Knigrufen, in which partners are chosen by calling Kings, which in Tarock are the highest cards of their suits. The use of the name Knigrufen for several different card games can cause confusion: in most parts of Austria, when Knigrufen is referred to it is the Tarock game that is meant. Another possible reason for the name is that in some versions, some players do like to call a King, in the hope that their partner may also have the Queen (Over) or the same suit, and can declare them for 40 points.\nKnigrufen (Rubach)\nThis game, played at Rubach in Tennengau, was described by Remigius Geiser in his article Die 100 Kartenspiele des Landes Salzburg in the journal Talon, No. 13, 2004, page 43.\nPlayers and Cards\nThere are four players, and a 32-card German suited pack (William Tell pattern) is used. In each of the four suits hearts, bells, acorns and leaves the cards rank from high to low Ace, Ten, King, Over, Under, Nine, Eight, Seven. In this card design, sold by Piatnik as \'Doppeldeutsche Karten\', the Aces have their suit symbols rotated and depict the four seasons, the Kings are mounted on horses, the Overs have their suit symbol at the top left of the card, and the Unders have their symbol lower down, just above the centre line of the card on the left. The Tens, Nines, Eights and Sevens are identified by Roman numbers as well as the number of pips. For example, here are the A, 10, K, O, U of acorns:\n\nThe aces, the tens and the last trick are worth 10 points each. They are known as "Gwisse". \nDeal and play are clockwise. \nDeal and Calling\nAny player may deal first. Thereafter the turn to deal passes clockwise. The dealer shuffles and the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The dealer deals a batch of four cards to each player and pauses. The player to dealer\'s left must now call, naming a card by rank and suit. The suit called becomes trumps, and the holder of the card called will be the caller\'s partner. After the call, the dealer completes the deal, giving another batch of four cards to each player so that everyone has eight. \nThe caller\'s partner must not announce his or her identity. This will become clear only during the play. Sometimes the caller has no partner, either because it was in the second batch of four cards dealt to the caller, or occasionally when the caller, having begun with a very strong initial batch of four cards, deliberately calls one of them so as to play alone.\nPlay\nThe caller, the player to dealer\'s left, leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible. A player who is unable to follow suit must play a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led and no trumps may play any card. Subject to these rules, each player must if possible beat the highest card so far played to the trick. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if it contains no trump by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nDuring the first trick, that is, at any time before the dealer completes that trick by playing a card, any player who holds the King and Over of a suit may declare it, saying 40 if the suit is trumps, or 20 if it is another suit. The cards are not shown, but will be seen by the other players in the normal course of play, so they can check that the announcement was valid. These points count for the declaring team if the player wins at least one trick: otherwise they do not count.\nDuring the first trick it is also possible for a player to announce that his or her team will take at least 100 points, or will win all the tricks, winning an extra payment if successful, but incurring a payment if not.\nScoring\nEach team counts the points in its tricks, and if no 20\'s or 40\'s have been declared the team with the majority of points - that is at least 50 - wins. However, a team that has declared 20 needs at least 60 points to win, a team that has declared 40 (or two 20\'s) needs at least 80 points to win and a team that has declared 60 needs at least 100 to win. This implies, for example, that if a team declares 40 and takes only 70 points, their opponents, who have declared nothing, win even though they have only 60 points.\nIt is not usual to score on paper: instead the players settle up in cash after each deal. When two play against two, one loser pays one winner and the other loser pays the other winner. When the caller has three opponents, the caller pays or receives the appropriate amount to or from all of them.\n\nFor a simple game, the usual payment is 10 cents.\nIf one side takes 100 or more points, without announcement, they win an extra 20 cents instead of 10.\nAnnouncing 100 points is worth 30 cents. The announcing team wins 30 cents  they succeed; if they take less than 100 points they must pay 30 cents.\nWinning all eight tricks, without announcement, is worth 20 cents extra, in addition to the payment for game or 100. So a team that wins 100 points and all the tricks without announcing either wins a total of 40 cents.\nAnnouncing that your team will win all the tricks is worth 30 cents, in addition to the payment for game or 100, which you win if you succeed and pay if you fail.\n\nRufmariasch\nThis very similar game,  played by the Donauschwaben - the German settlers on the banks of the Danube - in 18th and 19th century Hungary, is described by Rick Heli on his Card Games of the Donauschwaben page. \nAccording to Rick Heli\'s account, this game differed from Rubach Knigrufen as follows:\n\nWhen declaring a 20 or a 40, the player places both cards face up on the table, so the suit of the declaration is known to all.\nThere is no special payment for making 100 points or all the tricks, and no possibility to announce these.\nThe payment between the teams at the end of each deal is proportional to the difference between their points.\n\nThere is a variant in which the called card does not have to be a trump. The caller names both the trump suit and the called card, which can be in a different suit.\nAnrufen    \nLudwig and Christina Niesz provided a description of this game, which they used to play with their parents in the 1930\'s to 1950\'s. The location was given only as \'Germany and Austria\'. \nPlayers and Cards\nThis game is played by four people using a 24-card pack, the cards ranking from high to low A-10-K-Q-J-9 in each suit. There is also a hierarchy of suits, used to decide between rival bids. From high to low the suits rank: hearts-diamonds-spades-clubs.\nAces and tens are worth 10 points each; the other cards have no value, but winning the last trick is worth 10 points for a total of 90 points available in each deal. There are additional points for declaring marriages (king and queen of a suit in one hand): 40 in trumps and 20 in any other suit.\nDeal and play are clockwise and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nDeal, Bidding and Calling a Partner\nThe dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts, and the dealer deals out all the cards in batches of three, so that each player has a hand of six cards. The players then bid, beginning with the player to dealer\'s left. There are five possible levels of bidding:\n\nSimple game. The bidder, with a help of a partner, tries to take the majority of points - that is at least 50 if no marriages are declared.\n100 points. The bidder and partner try to take at least 100 points. They will need to declare at least one marriage since without marriages there are only 90 points in the game. The maximum possible number of points in a deal, if all four marriages are declared, is 190, so 100 will always be a majority.\nNo tricks. The bidder, playing alone, must avoid taking any tricks to succeed.\nAll tricks (Durchmarsch). Win all the tricks with the help of a partner.\nAll tricks with 100 points. With the help of a partner win every trick and declare at least one marriage, thus making at least 100 points.\n\nPlayers speak in turn, in clockwise order. Each bid must be higher than or equal to the last: a player who does not wish to bid can pass. No trump suit is mentioned in the bid unless two players make equal bids. If there are equal bids, the bidders  must each state their proposed trump suit: the bid with the higher trump suit stands and the bid with the lower suit is cancelled.\nIf someone bids, the bidding continues for as many circuits as necessary until all players except one have passed. If all four players pass initially, then everyone in turn has a second chance to bid. If everyone passes a second time the cards are shuffled a dealt again. (Variant: some play that in this case the dealer is forced to bid.) \nThe final bidder announces the trump suit and calls a card whose holder will be the bidder\'s partner, but must not announce his or her identity.\nNote. The Niesz description  does not mention this, but by analogy with other games of this type, it seems almost certain that the "No Tricks" bid must be an exception. This bid was almost certainly played without a partner and with no trumps, so if "No Tricks" was the highest bid, no partner or trump suit would be called.\nPlay\nThe winning bidder leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible. A player who is unable to follow suit must play a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led and no trumps may play any card. Subject to these rules, each player must if possible beat the highest card so far played to the trick. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if it contains no trump by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nA player who holds the king and queen of the suit may declare them for 40 points in trumps or 20 points in another suit. Such a declaration can only be made when the player is leading to the trick, and the player must lead one of the cards of the marriage (traditionally the queen) when making the announcement. This is called "registering" the marriage.\nDuring the first trick, the bidder\'s partner may increase the bid at his or her turn to play, announcing 100 or all the tricks or both if the bid does not already include these. In other words the bid can be increased from #1 to #2, #4 or #5, or from #2 or #4 to #5 in the above table.\nAlso during the first trick, any opponent of the bidder who thinks that the bid will not be fulfilled may say \'Contra\'. This increases the payment for the bid.\nIf the final bid was "No Tricks", there are no marriage registrations and no announcements of 100 or all tricks. It is still possible for an opponent who believes the bidder can be made to take a trick to  say "Contra". Although there are no trumps, the requirement to beat all cards previously played to the trick when possible still applies here.\nScoring \nThe score is traditionally kept using tokens, and each of the four players begins with 10 of these. When two players play against two, one member of the losing team pays one member of the winning team while the other pays the other. When one plays against three the lone player pays to or receives from all three opponents. \nThe teams count the points in their tricks. In a simple game, the team with the majority of points wins. If 100 or all tricks was included in the bid or announced subsequently, the bid succeeds only if these announcements are fulfilled - otherwise it fails. For example a player bids 100 points and registers a marriage for 20. The bidder\'s team take 90 points and the other team has 40. The bidder\'s team loses (even though they have the majority) because they failed to take 100 points as announced.\nThe number of tokens to be paid is as follows:\n\nSimple game: 1 token\nTaking at least 100 points, when announced: 2 tokens instead of 1.\nTaking all the tricks, when announced: 2 tokens instead of 1.\nTaking 100 points and all the tricks when both were announced: 3 tokens instead of 1 or 2.\n\nIf the bid was \'No Tricks\' the bidder wins 2 tokens from each opponent for losing every trick or pays 2 to each if forced to take a trick.\nIf Contra was said, the winners are paid 1 extra token.\nThree player version\nIt is possible for three to play this game. Seven cards each are dealt and three remain face down on the table. The bids are as above. The winning bidder does not call a partner, but instead picks up the three face-down cards and discards three cards face down (possibly some or all of them being the same cards) in their place. The bidder plays alone and the other two players form a team. Any counting cards (aces or tens) among the three discarded cards count for the bidder\'s opponents.\nKnigrufen (Graden)\nThis 24-card game, played  by farming families in Graden bei Kflach, a mountain village in western Styria, is described by Norbert Steinkellner on Spielewiki. It is said to have been played there for several generations, going back at least to the mid nineteenth century. In its present form, it is clearly a descendant of the other games described above, but it has been streamlined by disallowing the lowest bids - the simple game and the simple game with 100. The result is that the 10-scores for the aces, tens and last trick have all but vanished, surviving only in the special contract \'Schurln\' which is played when no one wishes to bid. There is no longer a trump suit, and the \'marriages\' survive only as an extra requirement for a player wishing to bid all the tricks with 100.\nPlayers and Cards\nThere are four players, and the game is dealt, bid and played clockwise.\nA French- or German-suited 24-card pack is used. The cards in each suit normally rank from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9 or A-K-O-U-10-9, but there are some bids in which the ten ranks between the ace and the king.\nThe Deal and Bidding\nAny player may deal first, and thereafter the turn to deal passes clockwise. The dealer shuffles and the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The dealer then deals out all the cards in packets of three, so that each player has six cards.\nThe player to dealer\'s left begins the bidding. There are nine possible bids, listed with their objectives and scores in the Contracts section below. Each player in clockwise order must either pass ( saying "gut") or bid higher than the previous bidder (Bettler is an exception - see below). If all four players pass, the special contract Schurln is played, to punish the player who passed with the best hand. If someone bids, the bidding continues for as many circuits as necessary until three players have passed. A player who has passed cannot bid at a subsequent turn.\nPlay and Scoring - General Rules\nThe highest bidder leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit to the led card if possible, and when following suit must if possible beat the highest card of that suit so far played to the trick. A player who cannot follow suit may play any card. The trick is won by the  highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nUsually the players settle up in money after each hand, and the payments are given in cents. If no money is available, the game is played for beans or nuts. When two players play against two, one loser pays one winner and the other pays the other. When one player plays alone against three, the lone player pays  or receives the appropriate amount to or from each opponent. In Bettler and Schurln, there are other possible situations, which will be described under those contracts.\nThe Contracts\nThe possible bids, in ascending order, are as follows.\n\n1. Bettler\nThe bidder undertakes to lose every trick, playing alone. The King is the second highest card. It is bid by placing the card one intends to lead to the first trick face down on the table. If Bettler has been bid and no one has bid higher, it is possible for another player also to bid Bettler rather than passing. The Mitbettler (the second Bettler) also lays down a card to be  played to the first trick. As soon as someone makes a higher bid,  the Bettlers are cancelled and the players must take their cards back. If no one bids higher, the first player who bid Bettler leads to the first trick, and in this first trick and the Mitbettler  must play the card that he or she put face down: the requirement to follow suit does not apply to this card. It may be possible to get rid of an ace this way, discarding it on a lead of a different suit, but if unluckily the first Bettler player leads the suit of the ace you put face down, you will have top play it and your contract fails. The score for Bettler played by one player is 30 cents. If there is a Mitbettler the payment is increased to 50 cents and the players settle up as follows.\n        \nIf both Bettlers succeed, each of the other two players pays 50 cents and each Bettler receives 50 cents.\nIf one Bettler succeeds and the other loses, the winner pays 150 cents to the loser, and the other two neither pay nor receive anything.\nIf both Bettlers lose, they each pay 100 cents and each of the other two players receives 100 cents..\n\n\n2. Durchmarsch mit einer anderen\nThe bidder undertakes to win every trick with the help of a partner. Before leading to the first trick, the bidder names a card whose holder will be the bidder\'s partner. This player must not announce who they are, and will become known only in the course of play. The King is the second highest card unless the bidder calls a Ten, in which case all suits rank with the Ten second highest, between Ace and King. The score for this contract is 40 cents.\n3. Durchmarsch am letzten\nThe King is the second highest card, and the bidder undertakes to win the first five tricks. Whoever wins the sixth trick will then be the bidder\'s partner and they win  40 cents. If the bidder wins the sixth trick, all three of the other players pay the bidder 40 cents. If the bidder loses any of the first five tricks, the bidder loses alone and has to pay 40 cents to each of the other three players.\n4. Plauderer\nThe bidder must lose every trick, playing alone. The King is the second highest card.  As in a Bettler, the bidder places the card to be led to the first trick face down on the table. If no higher bid intervenes, it is possible for another player also to bid Plauderer. This is known as mitplaudern. The Mitplauderer also  places a card face down, which will be played to the first trick if the Plauderers are played: the requirement to follow suit does not apply to this card. After the first trick, the opponents of the Plauderer place all their cards face up on the table and can discuss how to play. If there is also a Mitplauderer, only the two players who have not bid Plauderer expose their hands and can discuss the play. The player of a Plauderer wins 50 cents from each opponent, or pays them each 50 cents. If there are two Plauderers the payment is 100 cents and is settled in a similar way to Bettler. If both Plauderers win, each receives 100 from one of the other players; if just one wins the winner is paid 300 by the loser and the other two players pay nothing; and if both lose they each pay 200 and each of their opponents collects 200.\n5. Durchmarsch Hundert mit einer anderen\nThe bidder, who must hold the King and Queen (Over) of some suit, undertakes to win every trick with the help of a partner. Before leading to the first trick, the bidder names a card whose holder will be the bidder\'s partner, hidden until the called card is played. The Ten is always the second highest card of each suit, no matter what card is called. Score: 60 cents .\n6. Durchmarsch Hundert am letzten\nThe bidder, who must hold the King and Queen (Over) of some suit, undertakes to win the first five tricks. The Ten is the second highest card of each suit. Whoever wins the sixth trick will then be the bidder\'s partner and they win  60 cents. If the bidder wins the sixth trick, all three of the other players pay the bidder 60 cents. If the bidder loses any of the first five tricks, the bidder loses alone and has to pay 60 cents to each of the other three players.\n7. Zehnermord\nThe bidder undertakes to win all six tricks, playing alone.  The Ten is the second highest card of each suit. Score: 60 cents.\n8. Knigmord\nThe bidder undertakes to win all six tricks, playing alone.  The King is the second highest card of each suit. Score: 70 cents.\n9. Hundertermord\nThe bidder, who must hold the King and Queen (Over) of some suit, undertakes to win all six tricks, playing alone.  The Ten is the second highest card of each suit. This is the highest contract, scoring 80 cents.\n\nSpecial contract: Schurln\nThis contract cannot be bid. It is played only if all four players pass. The player to dealer\'s left leads to the first trick and the Ten is the second highest card of each suit. The aim is to avoid winning Aces and Tens in tricks and to avoid winning the last trick. When all six tricks have been played the players count the value of cards in the tricks they have won, counting 10 card points for each Ace or Ten. The winner of the last trick gets an extra 10 card points, so the total for all four players  will be 90 card points. The player with most card points pays 10 cents to each of the other players. If two players tie for most card points, each pays 10 cents and the others win 10 cents, and if three players tie (with 30 card points each), they each pay 10 cents to the player who has none.  \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Ace-Ten Games > Marriage Group > Anrufen / Knigrufen\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2013, 2014.

Pitch is All Fours with bidding added. Some of the newer versions of Pitch include other features such as extra points and an opportunity to improve one\'s hand by taking extra cards and discarding.\n\nThere are two main types of Pitch game: Partnership Pitch (played with partners, obviously) and Cutthroat Pitch (in which everyone plays for themselves). Whereas card game books tend to concentrate on Cutthroat Pitch, most of the e-mail I get is about Partnership Pitch, and this preference is reflected in the balance of information on this page. I have the impression that Cutthroat Pitch is more often played on the coasts, and usually for money. The various types of Partnership Pitch are most popular in the mid-west and are family or social games played to a score. There are many variations of pitch, mostly involving increasing the number of points from four to five,  ten or more by introducing extra scoring trumps.\n\nPartnership Pitch\n\nThis description is based on a contribution from Brian Gordon.\nPlayers and Cards\n\nThe deck is a standard American deck of fifty-two cards, ace high.  The game is usually for four players in two teams, partners sitting across from each other. The game is played clockwise.\n\nDeal\n\nEach player receives six cards, dealt three at a time. The turn to deal rotates clockwise after each hand.\n\nBidding\n\nThere is one round of bidding. The possible bids are two, three, four and smudge (smudge is really a bid of five).  Each player in turn either passes or bids higher than the previous bid if any, except for the dealer, who, having last bid, may "steal the bid" by bidding the same as the highest bid. The final bidder becomes the pitcher, and has the right to name trump and lead to the first trick.  \n\nIf the first three players pass, the dealer must bid at least the minimum bid of two. This is called a "force bid". \n\nThe bids represent how many of the following four items will be won when the tricks of the game are played out:\n\nHigh awarded to the team which holds the highest card in the trump suit in play, i.e. the ace if it has been dealt;\nLow awarded to the team which wins the trick containing the lowest trump card in play, i.e. the two if it has been dealt.  If the two is not dealt in play, the three may be low. If the three was not dealt either, the four, and so on;\nJack awarded to the team which wins the trick containing the jack of trumps. If the jack of trumps was not dealt no one gets this point;\nGame awarded to the team which has the higher total value of cards in its tricks. Card values are as follows: \n\n each ace 4 \n each king  3 \n each queen  2 \n each jack  1 \n each ten  10 \n\nThe total value of all the cards in the deck is 80, and whichever side has the higher total in its tricks gets the point for game. In case of a tie, no one gets this point.\n\n\nThe bid of smudge requires all six tricks to be won by the declaring side, in addition to the four items listed above.  (Sometimes a team can win all the tricks, but if the jack of trumps was not dealt, that is not sufficient to win a smudge bid.)\n\nThe play\n\nThe pitcher leads a card to the first trick, and the suit of this card becomes the trump suit. The winner of each trick leads the next, and may lead any card. A player who has a card of the suit led must either follow suit or trump. Players may play trump on any trick, even if they can follow suit.  A player who has no cards of the suit led can play anything - either a trump or a card of another suit.  Each trick is won by the highest trump card played, or if there are no trumps in it then by the highest card in the suit led.  \n\nScoring\n\nEach of the items High, Low, Jack and Game is worth one point. If you bid and make your bid, you get the number of points you make (in other words, if you bid two and make four, your team scores four points). However, to score five points (smudge), you need to actually bid smudge - if you bid four, and actually win all the tricks, including the jack of trump, you still only score four. The opposing team makes whatever number of points they earn. For example if the declarer\'s team bid two, but the opponents capture the 2 of trump, the opponents score one for Low.  \n\nIf a team fails to make its bid is said to be set. It loses (or is set back) the value of the bid, while the other team again scores whatever points it makes. \n\nNote that if a side that bids smudge loses a trick, the bid has failed and they will be set back 5 points no matter what happens after that. However, the play must be continued to the end to give the other side a chance to score points. \n\nA cumulative score is kept for each team. A team\'s score can be negative.\n\nWinning the Game\n\nIn order to win, a team needs at least 21 points, but they can only win at the end of a hand in which they made their bid. A team which reaches 21 or more on a hand where they are against the declarer - nor do they win if they bid and lose a contract, but still have 21 or more points.\n\nIt is therefore possible for the winning team to have fewer points than the losing team. For example, suppose that we have 18 points and they have 24, but they have not yet won because they acquired their last 4 points playing against our bids. If we now bid 3 and make it, and they take 1 point, we win, even though we have just 21 points while they have 25.\n\nPartnership Variations\nDraw\n\nAfter trump is declared, players discard any cards they don\'t want face down, and the dealer replenishes their hands to six cards from the undealt portion of the deck. It is illegal to discard trump, and normally, players will discard all their non-trump cards in the hope of replacing them with trump.  This makes it more likely that the ace, two, and jack will end up in play.\n\nPitching\n\nA player may lead (or "pitch") a card insetad of bidding. Pitching in this way is equivalent to a bid of four with the led suit as trump. If someone pitches, none of the other players can bid, except for the dealer, who still has the option to take the bid by pitching or announcing a smudge. If the dealer does take the bid in this way, the original bidder must take back the card they pitched. Some play that if the dealer does this and is set, the loss is doubled.\n\nSix players\n\nThe six player game is two against two against two, all sitting opposite their partners.  Instead of six cards, each is dealt eight. There is no draw, but everyone discards two cards after trump is announced.\n\nNo trumps on first trick.\n\nIn this variation, the declarer is allowed to make a non-trump lead. In this case it is illegal for any player to a play a trump on the first trick.  Usually the declarer will use this opportunity to lead the ace of another suit, so that partner may throw the ten (for game points) under it.\n\n \nSmear\n\nThere is a group of Pitch variations which go by the name of Smear. These are described on the Smear page of this site.\n\nFive Point Set Back\n\nOn his former Set Back page, Brad Wilson described a partnership version with five points: high, low, right, left, game. The "right bower" is the trump jack and the "left bower" is the off jack, ranking just below it. Note that these two cards rank between the queen and ten of trumps, not at the top of the suit as in Euchre.\n\nThis game is played with a 28 card pack: the cards from 3 to 8 of a 52 card pack are removed, leaving A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 2 in each suit. Six cards are dealt to each player, in threes, and the remaining cards are not used. You can bid any number from 1 to 5, and the bidding can go around the table several times if necessary, but you cannot bid any more after you have passed. When everyone has passed except the high bidder, or someone has bid five, the bidding ends. The high bidder nominates trumps and leads any card to the first trick. Players must follow suit, except that a non-trump lead may be trumped even if you have a card of the suit led.\n\nAs usual the bidding team score the points if they fulfill the bid, and are set back the amount of the bid if they don\'t. The bidder\'s opponents always score the points they make. The first team to reach 12 or more points wins.\n\nArizona 29-card Pitch\nThis is another game using a shortened deck: A-K-Q-J-10-9-6 in each suit plus a joker, ranking between the jack and ten of trumps. There are points for high, low, jack, joker and game. Here is an archive copy of the rules from  blakeware.com.\nOklahoma Ten Point Pitch\n\nThis variation from Oklahoma was contributed by Al Connor. It is very closely related to Minnesota Smear.\n\n1. Players and Cards.\nThe game is played by either four or six people in teams two, using a standard American 52 card deck with two distinguishable Jokers, designated high and low. The Jack of the same color as the Jack of trumps is known as the Off-Jack (for example, if clubs are trumps, the Jack of Spades is the Off-Jack). The Off-Jack and High and Low Jokers are part of the trump suit and the ranking of trumps from high to low is: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Off-Jack, High Joker, Low Joker, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two.\n2. Deal\nIf there are four players, each is dealt nine cards. If there are six players, each is dealt eight cards. The remaining undealt cards are placed face down to form a "widow" hand.3. Points\nThere are extra points for the Off-Jack and Jokers, and optionally for the three of trumps. This makes a total of ten or seven points to bid for. The points are:\n\nHigh: Scored by the team who hold the highest trump in play.\nLow: Scored by the team who hold the lowest trump in play (not by the team that wins it in a trick).\nJack: Scored by the team (if any) who win the jack of trumps in a trick.\nOff-Jack: Awarded to the team (if any) which wins a trick containing the  Off-Jack.\nHigh Joker: Awarded to the team which wins the trick containing the High                  Joker, if it is in play.\nLow Joker: Awarded to the team which wins the trick containing the Low                  Joker, if it is in play.\nTrey of Trumps: Three points are awarded to the team that wins the trick containing the Three of Trumps.\nNote: The 3 point score for the three of trumps is optional. If not used then there would be only seven points available for bidding.\nGame: Either as in the basic game, or some players award the point to the team that wins the trick containing the Ten of Trumps.\n\n4. Bidding\nThere is just one round of bidding. The minimum bid is two; the maximum is the total number of points available - either ten or seven, depending on whether you count the trey of trumps. The dealer is not allowed to "steal the bid".5. The Discard\nIf playing six-handed, the bid winner picks up the six cards from the "widow" and declares the trump suit. All players then discard down to six playing cards. The bid winner then starts the play.\n\nIf playing four-handed, the bidder declares the trump suit and then all players are allowed to discard from 0 to 3 cards, and receive an equal number of replacement cards from the deck (if sufficient are available), bringing their hands back to nine cards. All players then discard down to six cards. Some play without the discard and draw feature - the players simply each discard three cards. The bid winner then starts the play.\n6. The Play\nSome play that the bidder\'s first lead must be a trump; others play that anything can be led.  \n\nThere are three options for following suit, depending on house rules:\n\nPlayers who can follow suit must either do so or trump; players who cannot follow suit may play anything.\nPlayers who can follow suit must always do so; players who cannot follow suit may play anything.\n\nPlayers must either follow suit or trump unless unable to do either, in which case they can play anything.\n7. Scoring\nThe scoring and conditions for winning the game are the same as in the basic game, except that there is no \'smudge\'. \n\n\nDave Coleman-Reese reports a variation of this game without the Off-Jack and with no score for the Trump Three, so that there are 6 points to bid for.\n\nOn his web page, Larry Charbonneau describes another version of ten-point Pitch. Each of the four players is dealt nine cards, the minimum bid is four, and the dealer must take the bid for four if everyone else passes. After the bidder has named trumps the players discard all their non-trump cards and refill their hands to six cards. Any cards remaining in the stock are given to the bidder, who can take them or give them to partner without first looking at them. A player with more than six trumps must discard any excess trumps out of the game. \n\nIn the play, only trump plays are legal. A player who has no trumps left drops out of the play. If they won a trick with their last trump, the lead passes to the left. The game point goes to the side that wins the ten of trumps in a trick. The bidding side win the points they bid if successful, and lose the same amount otherwise. The first team to 52 points or more wins the game. A player can bid to "shoot the moon", for which their team has to rake all ten points; if they succeed they win the whole game if their previous score was zero or above, or advance to zero if their score was below zero; if they fail they lose the whole game.\n\nVariations are given for Pitch with other numbers of points by omitting some of the ten, or by adding other off-trumps (Off-Ace, Off-Ten, Off-Three, Off-Two) ranking just below their real counterparts. There is also "Dirty Pitch" in which the point for Low goes to the side that wins the Two rather than holding it, and "Reverse Pitch" in which the rank of the trumps is reversed (two high and ace low).\n\nHere is an archive copy of Maggie Stauffer\'s former Ten-Point Pitch page, which describes a similar game, in which only trumps can be played. There are versions for four and for five players.\n\nPawnee Ten Point Call Your Partner Pitch\nThis version was contributed by James Adams, whose brothers learned it while working for Boeing aircraft in Wichita Kansas in the 1950\'s. An archive copy of the rules can be found on his Pawnee Ten Point Call Your Partner Pitch web page. The game is normally played by five players using a 54 card pack including two jokers; points are one each for high, jack, off-jack, high joker, low joker, ten, low and three points for the three. The low point is acored by the team of the player that was dealt the lowest trump; the other points by the players who win the cards in play. Ten cards each are dealt, leaving four in the kitty. The minimum bid is five and the dealer must bid five if everyone else passes. The highest bid, for ten points, is called "shoot the moon" and is worth 42 points if successful.\nThe high bidder calls for a trump, and the holder of this trump is the bidder\'s partner. The high bidder takes the kitty and everyone discards down to six cards. Point scoring trumps (jacks, jokers and three) and the called trump cannot be discarded. Only trumps can be played; players who run out of trumps drop out of the play. The high bidder leads to the first trick, on which the called trump must be played. The bidding team each win the number of points they made if these are enough to fulfill the bid; otherwise they lose the amount of the bid. Each member of the opposing team acores the points made by that team. If the called trump is held by the high bidder (for example if it was in the kitty), the bidder plays alone against a team of four opponents. Game is 42 points. If more than one player reaches or exceeds 42 in the same hand, and the bidder is one of these, the bidder wins; if none of them is the bidder, further hands are played until a player has 42 ort more points after a successful bid.\nNine Card Pitch\n\nLike normal pitch this is for four players, two against two, with partners facing each other, but as the name suggests, nine cards are dealt to each player.\n\nIn additional to high, low, jack and game, there are two further points available:\n\nFive - scored by a team which wins the five of trumps in a trick;\nHigh spade - the highest spade in play, scored by the team which wins it in a trick.\n\nThe possible bids are three, four, five and six. After the pitcher has declared trumps, each player may discard up to four cards, to be replaced by cards from the undealt part of the deck. The play is as in normal Pitch, except that the pitcher is not required to lead a trump to the first trick. \n\nEach team begins with a score of 21, and their score for a hand is subtracted from this if they are successful. If they fail in their bid, they are said to "go up", and their bid is added to their score. The winners are the first team whose score reaches zero or less, but it is only possible to win on a hand where you succeed in a bid, or the opponents fail in their bid. If a team\'s points won in play would cause them to reach or pass zero while they were playing against a successful bid, that team\'s score becomes one.\n\nFish Pitch\n\nThis variation was contributed by Judd A. Schorr\n\nEach of the four players is dealt 12 cards from a 52 card pack: 6 for their hand and 6 which are kept face down in front of them. The bidding is as in normal Pitch. In the first trick everyone must play from their hand, but from then on, players can either play from their hand or \'fish\' a card from the unknown 6 in front of them. There are 12 tricks played in all, and all but 4 cards are out, so the two and jack of trumps are usually in play.  \n\nYou can try to take a trick that you really, really want by fishing a card on it, and sometimes you can make it.  However, sometimes, you give the opposite team low or an extra ten towards game. In this variant, even if you are dealt a poor visible hand, you are still in the action, as nobody knows what you will throw next.  It also makes it difficult (and fun) to \'count cards\' for two reasons - all the cards are out, and you can seemingly violate following suit by fishing a card.  (You can\'t tell for certain if a person is out of trump altogether, only that they are out of trump in their hand!) This variant is really a lot of fun, and should be tried.\n\nPitch with Fives, Pedro, Cinch, Catch Five\n\nThe version of Pitch in which the five is an additional scoring trump worth 5 points (making 9 points in all) is now described on the Pedro page, along with Double Pedro or Cinch, in which the other five of the same colour is also a trump scoring 5 (for a total of 14 points).\n\nCutthroat Pitch\n\nPitch can also be played by two or more players, each playing for themselves. The rules of bidding and play are the same as for the partnership game. In the game with more than two players, the opponents will tend gang up against the bidder to try to prevent the bid being made.\n\nMoney game\n\nBen Butzer reports that at UCLA, instead of playing up to 21 points for game, they would play for 10 cents per point. The game is played without partners. The scoring is as in the partnership game, except that each player individually scores the points they make. If you are the high bidder you are set back if the points you make are less than your bid.\n\nPlayers can join or leave the game after any hand. When the personnel change, the game is settled up: each player\'s score is compared to the average - winners receive 10 cents for each point they are above the average and losers lose 10 cents for each point below.\n\nThe smudge bid in this version is called shooting the moon or mooning. Mooning has no effect on your points score. If you shoot the moon successfully you win $1 from each other player (recorded on the scoresheet with a star). If you shoot and miss you pay out $1 each. \n\nMoon can only be bid over 4\n\nTom Price reports a version in which Moon can only be bid over a bid of 4 by another player. The only person who can bid over Moon is the dealer, who can still "steal" the bid. If you bid Moon and make it you gain 4 points, just as though you had bid 4; if you lose your score goes to 4 in the hole (i.e. minus 4), irrespective of what score you were on before. \n\nIn this game the players other than the eventual winner have to pay the winner an additional stake for each time they were set (as in the money version of Smear). A player who bids Moon and fails is charged for two sets.  \n\nRacehorse\n\nPatrick Mathews describes a version of the money game above, called Racehorse. This is usually played by 5 or more people, each playing for themselves. If the pitcher\'s bid succeeds, the pitcher receives $1.00 for each point bid from each of the other players. A pitcher whose bid fails pays $1.00 per point bid to each opponent. In either case, the other players do not receive anything for the points they make. The play of the hand ends as soon as it is clear whether the bid has succeeded, since further points won by either side do not affect payment.\n\nA pitcher whose bid fails is said to be "upped". Presumably this term derives from the practice of scoring in reverse in some Pitch variations - see for example Nine Card Pitch above.\n\nA pitcher who wins deals the next hand. If the pitcher is upped, the player to the pitcher\'s right deals the next hand, so that the upped pitcher has the first bid.\n\n14 point Tunkhannock Pitch\n\nThis game from Pennsylvania is somewhat related to the first version of partnership 10-point Pitch described above. It is normally played "cutthroat" by four people, but can also be played as a partnership game. A 54 card pack including two jokers is used -the off-jack, high joker and low joker rank in that order as trumps just below the jack. There is a six card deal and after the bidding three cards are discarded and the hands replenished. The minimum bid is 3, maximum is smudge (equivalent to 15), which is a bid to take all 14 points and six tricks. Dealer can steal the bid with an equal bid, and must bid three if the others all pass.\n\nThe points are high, low, jack, off-jack, high joker, low joker, game, last trick, high spade (worth one point each) and five (5 points). Points go to the player winning the card in a trick. The game point is scored by the player who takes most card points. Trumps need not be led at the start. You may trump even when you have the suit led, but you may only discard from a different non-trump suit when you cannot follow suit.\n\nDetailed rules can be found on this archive copy of Bill and Joe\'s 14 point Tunkhannock Pitch page.\n\nOther Setback / Pitch Web Sites\nUmesh Shankar\'s Setback Page has rules, variations and basic advice on strategy.\n\n  Here is an archive copy of Brad Wilson\'s former Set Back page, which described a five point version.\n\nLarry Charbonneau\'s 10 Point Pitch and Bill and Joe\'s 14 point Tunkhannock Pitch page describe further variations.\n\nPitch Software\nThe collection \nHOYLE Card Games for Windows or Mac OS X  includes a Pitch program, along with many other popular card games.\nYou can download Matt Reklaitis\' Nine Card Pitch program.\n\nSancho\'s Video Casino includes a webTV compatible Setback game to play on-line against the computer\n\nScott Olson has written a Pitch program with which you can play several variations of Pitch against computer opponents or live over a LAN or over the Internet. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > All Fours Group > Pitch / Setback\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1996, 1997, 2004.

No doubt it is so called because it is played with a 144-card pack made up four identical 36-card packs. It was described to me by Alexey Lobashev, who obtained the information from Mohamed Hassan of Mogadishu (Muqdisho).\nPlayers and Cards\nThe game is played by four players in fixed partnerships, two against two. I am told that it is played by adults only, not children. The pack of 144 cards is made by throwing out all the cards below 6 from four standard international 52-card packs. The ranking of cards from highest to lowest is as follows: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.\nDeal\nBefore the game, any player deals one card to each player, face up. The player who gets a highest card becomes the dealer for the first deal.\nThe dealer shuffles the cards and the player sitting on his leftcuts. Each player is then dealt 36 cards in batches of three.\nAfter the player sitting on the dealer\'s left gets the first three cards, the dealing is stopped and this player, having looked at his cards, calls the trump suit. Then dealing is resumed.\nTo check that the deal is correct, because there are very many cards, the dealershows everyone the numberof cards in the last batchhe dealt himself. If the number is more or less than three, the deal must be repeated.\nFor convenience the players sort the cards in their hands by suit and arrange them with red and black suits alternating.\n[It seems from this description that the deal and play are clockwise, even though the parent single-deck game Turup was played counter-clockwise. It is a little surprising that the cards are cut by the player to dealer\'s left, who also receives the first cards in the deal.]\nPlay\nThis is a plain trick taking game. The first to lead is the player sitting on the dealer\'s left. The players should follow suit. If they have no cards of the required suit, they can play a trump or any other card. As usual the highest trump, or if none are played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If two or more cards are played of the same suit and the same rank, the first of these is considered higher than the others. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nPartners can give signs to each other. For instance, having led a card one couldknock once on the table, which means \'This is my strong suit\'. If the player instead clicks his fingers, this would mean \'This is my weak suit\'. Signs can be given only by the player who has played the first card in the trick, not by any other player.\nWinning the game and the match\nAt the end of the game each partnership counts the tricks they have taken. The game is won by the party which takesmore tricks. To win the match, a partnership must win two games, without losing any games in between them,the number of tricks taken in the second game they win being more thaninthe first game they win. Consecutive games in which the tricks are equal, or in which the same party wins as in the previous game, but with insufficient tricks to win the match, are considered a draw, and the match continues.\nBefore the match, the players place a stake. The winners of the match takethe money.\nFor example, the first game is won by the party A with 41 tricks. The next game is again won by party A but with only 39 tricks, so is a draw. If in the third game, the party A wins with 42 or more tricks, they win the match. However, if the party B wins in the third game, then in the fourth game only party B will have an opportunity to win the match. If in the fourth game party A wins, it will be again considered their first winning game.\nIf the dealer\'s partnership wins, aplayer from the other partnership deals the next game; if dealer\'s partnership loses orcomes to a draw,the same party deals. In case of loss, the players in the same partnership deal in turns. In case of a draw the same dealer deals again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Whist group > Arpaa Turup\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2009.

Club of America. I have added some common variations.\n\nIntroduction\nPlayers and CardsSequence of Hands\nObject of the Game\nDeal\nBidding\nPlay\nScoring\nVariations\nRelated Games\nOther Oh Hell WWW Pages\n\nSoftware, Online Games, Score Sheets and Scoring Applications\n\nIntroduction\nThis game, in which players try to predict the exact number of tricks they will win, first appeared in London and New York in the 1930\'s and has since become popular in many parts of the world. Its original name Oh Hell! evidently offended some people and has been bowdlerised in many books to Oh Pshaw! or Oh Well!, while others  have preferred more robust alternatives such as Oh Shit! Some call it Blob or Blackout, perhaps because of the practice of recording a player\'s bid on the scoresheet and then obliterating it with a black blob if the player failed to take the predicted number of tricks. Traditionally the size of the players\' hands increases or decreases by one in each deal, and this has given rise to the names Elevator (l\'Ascenseur in France), Up and Down the River (in Australia and New Zealand) and 10 op en neer in the Netherlands. In Britain it is often known as Nomination Whist, a name which also sometimes refers to different games. Other names include Bust (in Australia and New Zealand), Boerenbridge (in the Netherlands), Kachuful (in India) and German Bridge (in Hong Kong).\nPlayers and Cards\n\nFrom 3 to 7 people can play. The game is best when played with 4 to 6.\n\n\n\n  A standard 52 card deck is used. The cards in each suit rank (from high to low) A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.\n  \nSequence of Hands\n\nThe game consists of a series of hands. The first hand is played with 7 to 10 cards dealt to each player, depending on the number of players:\n\n3 to 5 players, 10 cards each;\n6 players, 8 cards each;\n7 players, 7 cards each\n\n(because of the limit of 52 cards available). Each successive hand is played with one card fewer, down to a hand of just one card each, then one card more per hand back up to the starting level. \n\nExample: With 7 players, the hands are: 7 cards, then 6,5,4,3,2,1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7, for a total of 13 hands to the game. A game should take approximately 45 minutes.\n\nObject of the Game\n\nThe object is for each player to bid the number of tricks he thinks he can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many; no more and no fewer. Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly, and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or under (see scoring below).\n\nThe hook is that at least one player will fail on each hand, because the total number of tricks bid by the players may not equal the number of tricks available on that hand.\n\nDeal\n\nTo determine the first dealer, draw cards. The player with the highest card deals first. The turn to deal rotates clockwise with each hand.\n\nThe cards are shuffled and cut and the dealer deals the cards singly until everyone has the appropriate number of cards for the hand being played. The next card is turned face up and the suit of this card is the trump suit for the hand. The trump suit beats any of the other three suits played in that hand. The remaining undealt cards are placed in a face down stack with the turned trump on top of it.\n\nBidding\n\nThe bidding in each hand begins with the player to the left of the dealer, then continues clockwise, back around to the dealer, who bids last. Each bid is a number representing the number of tricks that player will try to take. Everyone must bid - it is not possible to pass, but you can bid zero, in which case your object is to take no tricks at all. A bid may be changed only if the next player to the left has not yet bid. Remember the hook: the dealer may not bid the number that would cause the total number of tricks bid to equal the number of tricks available; a hand will always be "over-bid" or "under-bid". Keep in mind when bidding that not all cards in the deck are in play in any hand.\n\nPlay\n\nThe play begins with the player to the dealer\'s left, who leads the first card. The lead may be any suit (including trump). Play follows clockwise. Each player must follow the suit led, if he can. If not, he may play any other card in his hand, including trump. The player who has played the highest trump card, or if no trump was played, the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick. That player then leads to the next trick. Continue until all tricks have been played and won.\n\nScoring\n\nThe scorekeeper is designated prior to each game according to house rules. The scorekeeper, needless to say, has a distinct advantage, and should be monitored closely for "inadvertent" errors. The designated scorekeeper notes each bid and resulting scores on a score sheet. There are many different ways to score Oh Hell!\n\n\nIn the simplest version, a player who wins the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the number of tricks bid (10 points for zero tricks, 11 for 1 trick, 12 for two tricks, etc.) Players who take more or fewer tricks than they bid score nothing. This method has the advantage that the scorekeeper, having written down the bids at the start of the play, can simply write a figure "1" in front of those that were successful and delete those that are not. The game with this scoring method is often known as Blackout or Blob, because the scorer obliterates or blacks out unsuccessful bids, so that they become black blobs on the score sheet. \n\nPerhaps the most widespread scoring method is to award 1 point for each trick won plus a bonus of 10 points for players who win exactly the number of tricks they bid. So for example a player who bid 2 would score 12 points for winning exactly 2 tricks, but only 1 for 1 trick and 3 for 3 tricks. This gives a player whose bid fails a slight incentive to win as many tricks as possible.\n\nSome other scoring methods are given in the variations section below. Whatever method is used, the score keeper keeps a cumulative total of each player\'s score. The final cumulative scores determine the result. If the game is played for money, players pay or receive amounts corresponding to the difference of their scores from the average.\n\n\nSeveral people have produced preprinted Oh Hell score sheets and applications, reflecting various scoring methods. \nVariations\nSequence of Hands\n\nThere are a lot of variations of this. Some people start from 1 card each, go up to the maximum number of cards and then back down to 1. Some just go from the maximum down to 1 and then stop, or vice versa. If there are four people the maximum number of cards dealt may be 13 rather than 10, with three people you can go up to 17. Some people go up to some other maximum, such as 7 cards, irrespective of the number of players.\n\nDan Strohm describes a version, called Devil\'s Bridge, in which the hand size increases and then decreases. On the final 1 card hand, the players must each hold their card on their forehead, so each player can see all the other player\'s cards but not their own.\n\n\nBryce Francis reports that in Australia, when playing Bust with 5 players, they add 13 low cards from a second pack to make a 65 card pack, so as to deal 13 cards each on the first hand as with 4 players. When there are six players they add a further 13 low cards, so that the bottom half of the pack is duplicated. If duplicate cards are played to a trick, the second played beats the first.\n\nA 3-player game is also possible, removing 13 low cards from a single pack.Determining Trumps\n\nSome sequences include hands in which all cards are dealt (for example 13 cards each to 4 players). There is of course then no card left to determine the trump suit. These hands are played without trumps. Some play the largest deals without trumps even if not all the cards are used.\n\nInstead of turning up a card, some people go through the possible trump suits in a fixed sequence. This sequence may or may not include "no trumps".\n\nIn the Indian (Gujurati) game Kachuful, the sequence of trump suits is spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts and the name of the game, which literally means \'raw flower\', is also a mnemonic for this sequence: Ka = Kari = Spades,\nChu = Chukat = Diamonds, \nFu = Falli = Clubs, L = Lal = Hearts\n\n  Brad Wilson describes a version called "Oh Shit!" in which Spades are always trumps.\n\nJean-Pierre Coulon reports a variation in which after the appropriate number of cards have been dealt to the players, the next card is turned face up. If the rank of the turned up card is from 2 to 6, there are no trumps for the deal; if it is 7 or higher, the suit of the turned up card is trumps.\n\nBidding\n\nSome people play without the hook rule, so the dealer is allowed to bid in such a way that everyone can win. There was a lively discussion in rec.games.playing-cards as to which version is more skilful, with strong advocates of each. Some think that hands where the bids add up are too easy; but others say that forcing the bids not to add up removes a tactical option from the dealer.\n\nSome play with simultaneous bidding. When the players are ready to bid, they put a fist on the table.  When everyone\'s fist is out, the group says "One, Two, Three" while bouncing their fists on the table. On Three, everyone must stick out some number of fingers (possibly zero) to indicate how many tricks they will try to take. Of course, with this method, there\'s no restriction against the total number of bid tricks being equal to the number of cards dealt. Since players cannot adjust their bids based on the other players\' bids, the total tricks bid can be wildly different from the tricks available - for example it is not uncommon for three or four players to bid "one" when only one card was dealt. Several correspondents report that in Australia, most groups use simultaneous bidding rather than bidding in turn.\n\nPlay\nSome play that the dealer, rather than the player to dealer\'s left, leads to the first trick.\nDavid Wuori (of Maine, USA) reports a variation in which a player who has no card of the suit led must trump. Only if you have no cards of the suit led and no trumps can you discard from a different non-trump suit. Although this is rule is uncommon in English speaking countries, it is actually the usual way of playing La Podrida (the Spanish equivalent to Oh Hell played in Latin America and in Spain) as well as the equivalent Romanian game of Whist.\nMark Brader suggests a variation in which two jokers are included, to make a 54-card deck. These jokers are a suit of their own containing just two equal cards. If a joker is led it wins the trick unless trumped. If a joker is turned up the other joker is the only trump. \nDick Atkinson reports a version of Blackout for 5 or 6 players, played in Northeast England in the 1970s. Two jokers are added to the pack, and if there are 5 players the four deuces are removed leaving 50 cards. With 5 players the deal is always 10 cards each and with 6 players 9 cards each. The trump suit rotates from deal to deal in the order hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades. The dealer could not make the bid total equal the number of cards dealt. Jokers could not be led (unless the player had no other cards) and could not be played in  the first trick. Apart from that, a joker could be played to any trick (even if the player could have followed suit). The first player of a joker could nominate it as either "high", automatically winning the trick or "low", automatically losing. The player of the second joker had no choice: it would be low if the first joker was high and high if the first was low. If a player was forced to lead a joker, the first suited card played determined the suit of the trick.\nScoring\n\nThere are many alternative systems.\n\nSome players give the usual 10-point bonus for a successful positive bid but award only 5 points for a successful bid of zero. Others award 5 plus the number of cards dealt to each player for a successful zero bid, recognising the fact that zero is more difficult when more cards are dealt.\nSome score 10 points for each trick bid and won for a successful bid. A successful "zero" bid wins 10 points. A player whose bid is unsuccessful (over or under) loses 10 points times the difference between the number of tricks won and the number of tricks bid.\nAnother system is that you win 5 points if you are right plus 10 for each trick taken, and you lose 5 points if you are wrong plus an extra 5 for each trick difference from your bid.\nYet another system: if you make your bid exactly you score 10 points plus the square of the number of tricks you bid (i.e. 10 points for none, 11 for one, 14 for two, 19 for three, 26 for four, etc.); if you fail you lose the square of the difference between the number of tricks you bid and the number of tricks you took.\nSome play for a single winner, who is the player with the highest score when the whole series of hands has been played. In case of a tie after the last hand, some deal further hand(s) with the maximum number of cards until a clear winner is determined. The winner may not be any of those involved in the original tie - any player can win until the end.\n\nMore variations\nThe Oh Hell Variations page in the Invented Games section of this site has a collection of Oh Hell variations contributed by readers.\nA version of Oh Hell! under the Dutch name Boerenbridge was formerly available to play against three computer opponents at  Kaartspellen online (www.useme.nl/kaartspellen). In the variation offered there: \n\n\nThe whole pack is dealt every time - 13 cards each to four players. \nBidding is simultaneous. \nScore 1 point for each trick won, plus a bonus of 10 is you make your bid exactly. \nIf you bid and make zero you score 20 points. \nIf your score is 80 or more you do not take part in the bidding, but just score 1 for each trick you win. \nThe objective is to score exactly 100; if you go over 100 you bounce back - your excess over 100 is subtracted from 100. \n\n\nRelated games\n\nLa Podrida is the equivalent Spanish game to Oh Hell!, played with a 52-card pack. There is also a similar game La Pocha, played with the 40-card Spanish deck. \n\nRomanian Whist is a variation of Oh Hell!, played in Romania with a 32-card pack.\n\n\nDavid Parlett\'s 36-card game Ninety-Nine is based on similar principles, but with an extra twist to the bidding.\n\nGerman Bridge is a version of Oh Hell played in Hong Kong. You gain  (10 + (bid)2) if successful and lose (bid - tricks)2 if not.\nNominations or Clag is a British variant which adds some extra deals with special rules.\nOther Oh Hell WWW pages\nDavid Zechiel\'s page gives Al Okenuff\'s rules of Oh Hell, in which the highest bidder chooses trumps; the scores for high bids escalate in such a way that it is worth going set on a low bid if by doing so you can destroy the high bidder\'s bid as well.\nNicholas Cheung\'s Oh Hell page.\n\nRules of Oh Hell are available on the Card Game Heaven site.\nArchive copy of Dave Barker\'s former page of Rules for Oh Hell\nArchive copy of Brad Wilson\'s former Oh Shit! page.\nJean-Franois Bustarret\'s page L\'Ascenseur has rules in French.\n\nSoftware\nMalcolm Bain\'s shareware Oh Hell program for Windows includes a Blackout-style scoring option. \nSean O\'Connor\'s shareware Oh Hell program is available under the name Niggle - you can buy it or download a free trial version.\nYou can download a freeware Oh Hell! program from Thanos Card Games.\nFar Whist is a free program by Vincent Brvart with which you can play Elevator Whist, Oh Hell!,  Romanian Whist and many other variations.\nFrom Axel Brink\'s 10 op en neer page (in Dutch) you can obtain his computer program that plays a variation of Oh Hell in which the number of cards dealt per hand are: 1, 2, ..., 9, 10, 9, ..., 1. There is no hook rule. If a player makes his bid exactly, he gets 10 points plus his bid. If he misses his bid (over or under), he gets 0 points.\nJack Marrows has written a two-player Oh Shit! program with which you can play online against the computer. His version has the unusual feature that the jack of trumps is highest, followed by the other jack of the same colour, as in Euchre or 500.\nAlex Quarmby has written a Contract Whist (Oh Hell) app for Android, with which you can play against up to 5 computer opponents.\nJavier Garcia has written an Oh Hell! app for iPad, and apps for the similar South American games La Pocha and La Podrida for iPhone.\nAt DKM Oh Hell from the CardSharp suite you can play online against three computer opponents a version of Oh Hell with 10 card deals throughout.\nOnline Oh Hell!

In Australia it is often called Warlords and Scumbags, perhaps because the politician Paul Keating once famously used the word "scumbag" to describe his opponents. In France it is Trouduc or Trou du Cul; in Germany: Einer ist immer der Arsch; in Hungary it is Hbres (vassal); in the Netherlands it is Sluitspieren or Klootzakken.\n\n\nThe game has recently spread throughout the Western world, especially among young people, but is probably of Chinese origin. In games of this type (which I call climbing games), each player in turn can either pass or play a card or combination which beats the previous play, and the usual object is to get rid of all one\'s cards as soon as possible. Such games have been known in the West only since the 1970\'s, but there are many of them in China, perhaps the most famous being Zheng Shangyou. The immediate ancestor of President is perhaps the Japanese game Dai Hin Min. \nAs the game has spread, numerous variations have developed. I will describe a typical basic version first, and list some variations at the end. As the variations are so numerous, I have tried to group them into types for easier reference. \n\nThe Basic Game\nObjective\n\nThe aim is to get rid of all your cards as soon as possible. The last player left with cards is called the scum, asshole, or whatever term of derision is locally used.\n\nPlayers and Cards\n\nAbout 4 to 7 people using a standard 52 card pack. The suits are irrelevant and the cards rank, from high to low, 2 A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3.\n\nDeal\n\nThe game is played clockwise. All the cards are dealt out. Some players may have one more than others.\n\nPlay\n\nThe player to dealer\'s left starts by leading (face up) any single card or any set of cards of equal rank (for example three fives). Each player in turn must then either pass (i.e. not play any cards), or play face up a card or set of cards which beats the previous play.\n\nA single card is beaten by any higher single card. A set of cards can only be beaten by a higher set containing the same number of cards. So for example if the previous player played two sixes you can beat this with two kings, or two sevens, but not with a single king, and not with three sevens (though you could play two of them and hang onto the third).\n\nIt is not necessary to beat the previous play just because you can - passing is always allowed. Also passing does not prevent you from playing the next time your turn comes round. \n\nThe play continues as many times around the table as necessary until someone makes a play which everyone else passes. All the cards played are then turned face down and put to one side, and the player who played last (and highest) to the previous "trick" starts again by leading any card or set of equal cards.\nFor example the play might go:\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\n\n44\nPass\nPass\n66\n99\n\n\nJJ\nPass\nPass\nPass\nKK\n\n\nPass\nPass\nAA\nPass\nPass\n\n\nPass\nPass\n\n\n\n\n\nC then starts again by leading any card or set.\n\n\nWhen a player whose turn it is to play has no more cards left, the turn passes to the next player in rotation. Therefore in the example, if the two aces were C\'s last two cards, it would then be D\'s turn to play anything.\n\nSocial Status\n\nThe first player who is out of cards is awarded the highest social rank - for Americans this is President - the next is Vice-President, then Citizen and so on down. The last player to be left with any cards is known as the Beggar, Scum, Asshole or by various terms of abuse. For Europeans the ranks can be King, Minister, ... , Peasant or Boss, Foreman, Worker, Bum. \n\nIf keeping score, the players get points depending on their position - for example 2 for the President, 1 for the Vice President and nothing for the others. More importantly, the players of higher status are entitled to enjoy and generally abuse their power over the lower ranking players. \n\nFor the next hand the players move seats. The President selects the most comfortable chair, the Vice President sits to the President\'s left, and so on around to the Asshole who sits to the President\'s right, probably on a crate or packing case.\n\nThe Asshole is responsible for shuffling, dealing and clearing away the cards when necessary. As the players are now seated clockwise in order of rank, the first card is dealt to the President, the second to the Vice President, and so on down.\n\nWhen the deal is complete, the Asshole must give his highest card to the President, and the President gives back in exchange any card which he does not want. \n\nThe President then leads any card or set of cards and the game continues as before.\n\nEnd of Game\n\nIf scoring, set a target and the game ends when someone reaches (say) 11 points.\n\nVariations in playing procedure\nOpening Lead\n\nOn the first deal, some play that the player holding a specific card of the lowest rank leads. Generally this will be a three, for example the 3, but in variations where threes are wild it will be a four.\n\nOn subsequent deals, some play that the Scum from the previous hand leads, rather than the President. \n\nSingle-round play\n\nSome people play that after someone leads, each player gets just one opportunity to pass or beat the previous play. Whoever played highest then leads again. So in the example given before, if the play went:\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\n\n44\nPass\nPass\n66\n99\n\n\nA does not get a chance to beat E\'s pair of 9\'s. It is now E\'s turn to lead any card or set.\n\n\nI think that multi-round play, as in the basic game, must be the original method. All the Chinese climbing games use it. Probably single-round play is a Western modification, influenced by trick-taking games.\n\nCompulsory beating\n\nSome people play that if you can beat the previous play, you must. Passing is only allowed if you are unable to play. Again, I believe this is a recent modification, and it seems to make the game less interesting.\n\nNo playing after passing\n\nIn Australia, some people do not allow a player who has passed to play at subsequent turns during the same trick. If you pass, you must wait until someone wins the trick and leads again. So the play example given above would look like this:\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\n\n44\nPass\nPass\n66\n99\n\n\nJJ\n\n\nPass\nKK\n\n\nPass\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that A, B, C and D have passed, E\'s pair of kings cannot be beaten; the cards are set aside, E leads a new card or set, and everyone is allowed to play again. \nGeneral variations in which cards can be played when\nLarger sets of cards beat smaller sets of lower rank\n\nSome people do not require players to play an equal number of cards to the card or set they are beating. It is also possible to play more cards than the previous player, as long as they are also higher in rank than the previous play. For example, in this variation:\n\na single 8 could be beaten by a single 10 or a pair of 10s, but not by a pair of 5s; \na pair of 9s can be beaten by two or more 10s but not by a single 10.\n\nLarger sets beat smaller sets irrespective of rank\n\nAnother variation found occasionally is that a set of more cards beats a set of fewer cards irrespective of rank, so that a single 9 can be beaten by a pair of fives, which in turn could be beaten by three fours. \n\nEqual plays allowed\n\nSome people allow a card or set to be beaten by another card or set of equal rank. For example a pair of sevens can be beaten by another pair of sevens, or by any higher pair.\n\nEqual play skips next player\n\nSome people play that if you beat a play with an equal play, the turn skips the next player who has cards, and passes to the player after that. In particular this means that if there are only two players left in and you equal the previous play, you immediately get another turn to play.\n\nWhen this variation is combined with the variation that allows a larger set of cards on a smaller set, it may be that if more than one equal card is played, more than one player is skipped. For example if a six is played, and the next person plays two sixes, the following two players are skipped; if three sixes were played on a six the next three players would be skipped.\n\nFour of a kind inverts ranks\n\nThis can be combined with the suit ranking variation described below. When a player plays four of a kind, then for the rest of that deal, the rules of play are changed.  From that point on, each player must play a card (or combination) lower than the previous play (and now between two pairs of the same rank, the one containing the club is lower and therefore beats the other.)  If another 4 of a kind is played, then the order is reversed back the original.  This tends to produce reversals of fortune, breaking the cycle of the 1st place player after winning several hands in a row.\n\nFour of a kind reverses ranks and direction of play\n\nThis variation was reported by Hamish Allan of Scotland. Equal plays are allowed, and if four single cards of the same rank are played in succession (with or without passes in between), or if one player plays a set of four equal cards, then the direction of play and the ranking of cards reverses. This is called a revolution. Playing a pair on an equal pair does not cause a revolution, however.\n\nIn the normal ranking, threes are transparent and the two is high and low. In reversed ranking threes are still transparent but now aces are highest and lowest - so the rank from high to low is (A)-2-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-(A); a single ace beats anything and anything beats an ace.\n\nOther types of card combination can be played\n\nIt is possible to allow other card combinations to be played besides sets of equal rank.\n\nif you add single and multiple sequences the game becomes rather like Zheng Shangyou;\nif you add poker-like combinations such as full houses the game becomes like Big Two.\n\nVariations in the cards used and their ranking\nDouble Deck\n\nWhen there are a lot of players, a double deck of cards is sometimes used.\n\nAces high\n\nSome people play with aces as the highest cards - the cards rank from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2.\n\nJokers\n\nSome people include one or more jokers in the pack. These usually rank above the twos. If the jokers are distinguishable, it may be agreed that the coloured (or otherwise more impressive) joker beats the other one.\n\nSome people also use jokers as wild cards, which can represent any rank. Some play that a natural combination beats an otherwise equal combination containing a wild card (e.g. 6-6-6 beats 6-joker-joker), some play that the combination with wild cards beats the natural one, and some play that they are equal - so that neither beats the other (or each beats the other if equal plays are allowed).\n\nAnother variation is to use the jokers only as wild cards, with no intrinsic rank of their own.\n\n40 card pack (Klootzakken)\n\nC.A. van Wijk reports that in the Netherlands, Klootzakken is played with a 40 card pack lacking 4\'s, 5\'s and 6\'s, the cards ranking from high to low: 3 2 A K Q J 10 9 8 7. Cards are not set aside after a trick but accumulate in a pile on the table.  There is no changing of seats at the end of a hand, but the winner trades two unwanted cards for the loser\'s best two cards. The loser plays first in the next hand.\n\nVariations involving particular cards\nSingle two wins\n\nSome people play that a single two beats any combination (in the basic game you would need three twos to beat three aces). The person who plays the two clears away the cards (or directs the Scum to clear them away, if you play that the Scum has to do this) and leads anew.\n\nTwo is highest and lowest\n\nIn this variation a single two can be played at any time, but the play continues and the next player can play anything. This rule may have been borrowed from Shithead, another recent card game played predominantly by young people worldwide.\n\nJokers\n\nAs with the two, when it is highest, some people play that a single joker beats any set of lower cards.\n\nBlack threes or jack of diamonds high\n\nSometimes players use some other specific card(s) as high cards beating the twos - such as the jack of diamonds or the black threes.\n\nJokers, jacks and twos high\n\nSofia, from Toronto, reports a version in which the rank of the cards from the top is: joker, jack, two, ace, king, queen, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. The jokers, jacks and twos have special powers:\n\nAny pair of aces or below can be beaten by a single two, jack or joker.\nAny three of a kind of aces or below can be beaten by a pair of twos, or by a single jack or joker.\nAny four of a kind of aces or below can be beaten by three twos, two jacks or a single joker. \n\nThese numbers of cards are all doubled if playing with two decks. \nJokers, Twos and Threes Wild\n\nIn Hbres (the Hungarian version of the game), all the jokers, twos and threes are all wild. Played along with a normal card (or cards) they take on the rank of that card; played singly or in entirely wild sets they rank highest and all equal to each other.\n\nTwos high, threes and jokers wild\n\nIn this version all the threes and the two jokers are wild cards that can represent any other card. The twos are the highest cards but have no special property.\n\nTransparent cards\n\nSome people play that threes (or some other agreed rank if threes have another meaning) are transparent. This means that you can use a three to beat any single card, and a set of threes to beat an equal number of cards of any rank, and the threes you play take on the rank of the cards they have beaten. For example if A plays a pair of kings and B beats it with a pair of threes, the threes count as kings and subsequent players have to beat a pair of kings or pass. If all pass, B\'s threes have won, the cards are cleared away and B leads.\n\nThrees high, below the two\n\nSome play that a single three can beat any card or set except a two. A three can be beaten by a two (unbeatable) or a four (fours are transparent in this version).\n\nVariations involving Suits and Colours\nFollowing Suit\n\nIn this variation, a single card can only be beaten by a higher card of the same suit. This makes it much harder to get rid of single cards.\n\nReversing Colour\n\nThis is a variation on allowing equal plays. You can beat a single card with an equal ranked card, provided that it is the opposite colour - so a red five can be beaten by a black five, but not by another red five. A set of cards can be beaten by an equal ranked set provided that the colour of each card is reversed - for example two red sevens beat two black sevens, and a red and a black seven beats a black and a red seven.\n\nSuit Ranking\n\nTheodore Hwa reports a variation in which the suits rank spades (high), hearts, diamonds, clubs (as in Bridge). When playing single cards, a card of equal rank to the previous card can be played, provided that the suit is higher. For example if someone played the 7 you could beat this by playing the 7 or the 7 or any 8 or higher card, but you could not play the 7, because clubs are lower than diamonds.\n\nBetween equal ranked pairs, the pair containing the spade is higher, irrespective of the suit of the other card. So for example, the pair Q-Q can be beaten by the pair Q-Q.\n\nVariations in Social Structure and Scoring\nJoining and leaving a game\n\nPlayers may leave the game after any hand. The players below them then move up one place in rank.\nNew players may join the game after any hand, and they start in the lowest position (asshole or scum).\n\nCard Exchange\n\nThe President receives the Scum\'s two highest cards, and gives the Scum any two cards in exchange.  The Vice President and the second-to-last player exchange one card similarly.\n\nJames Lundeen reports a version (called Butthead) in which the Butthead passes the President his two best cards and the President passes the Butthead three of his choice.  Similarly the vice-butthead and vice-president trade one and two cards respectively.  This makes it harder to get out of the butthead position as you are passed more bad cards.\n\nExpose a card to assign hands\n\nAfter the deal but before the players pick up their cards, the top card of each hand is turned up. The president gets the hand with the highest card facing up, vice president gets the second highest and so forth.\n\nTrading Cards\n\nIn this version the players in the middle of the order are called merchants (so with six players the ranking could be Landlord, Noble, Upper merchant, Lower merchant, Peasant, Scum). While the lowest players must give their best cards in exchange for the highest players\' unwanted cards, the merchants in the middle must trade. That is, they must give each other one card, but they can haggle as to which cards to trade, and in this way they may both be able to improve their hands. The haggling might begin: \nUM: "I have a seven"\nLM: "I have an eight. Want to trade?"\nUM: "I don\'t need an eight. How about a nine?"\nand so on. If they can\'t agree, they must give each other a card anyway - in this case each will give an unwanted card to the other. \n\nAnthony O\'Dea suggests a more extreme version of this, called "The Hand of Collusion". With six players, everyone\ngets 9 cards (both Jokers used). Players then "collude" in pairs, swapping as many cards as necessary. Usually the President colludes with the Arsehole, the 2nd player with the 5th and the 3rd with the 4th. After collusion, everyone must still have 9 cards. Play then proceeds as normal.  The first to go out gets 6 points, and so on. Winners are\nthe pair with the most points. \n\nScoring\n\nAnother scheme, when playing with 5 or 7 players, is as follows. With 5 players the scores given to the players, from first to last, are 2, 1, 0, -1, -2. With 7 players the scores are 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3. The scores for a hand also indicate how many cards each loser has to exchange with each winner at the start of the next hand.\n\nFixed seats\n\nSome people play without switching seats after each hand. It is still the Asshole who shuffles and deals and the President who leads to the first trick (or the Scum leads if you play that version).\n\nHats\n\nIn Hamish Allan\'s version, the players wear hats corresponding to their social rank. When there is a revolution, everyone turns their hat inside out. Also in this version, if you are the top ranking player (in this case called the Rich Man) and you fail to win, you must immediately throw in your cards and you become the lowest ranking player (Poor Man). The player who ran out of cards first is the Rich Man and the others continue playing for the remaining positions.\n\nOnly the Scum may touch the cards\n\nAfter the first card is played, no one is allowed to touch any cards on the table except the Scum. If you do, then you automatically become the Scum for the next round. Note that you only become the Scum if you deliberately reach out and touch the cards; someone throwing the cards at you doesn\'t count.  \n\nProcedural Faults\n\nThe winning player (in this version called the Landlord) shuffles and the Scum cuts, after which the Landlord deals. Forgetting to offer the cards to be cut, or any kind of misdeal is a fault. After two faults the Landlord becomes the Scum and everyone else moves up one place. The Landlord also becomes the Scum if there are two consecutive games in which the result does not lead to a change in the players\' positions.\n\nHbres\n\nIn Hbres, when played by six people, the ranks are Kirly, Nagybirtokos, Kisbirtokos, Nagyparaszt, Kisparaszt, Mocsr (king, big landowner, small landowner, big peasant, small peasant, swamp). The king and swamp exchange three cards, the big landowner and small peasant two cards, and the small landowner and big peasant one card.\n\nOther WWW sites\n\nOther versions of this game can be found on \n\nNicholas Cheung\'s President page.\nThe Sunshine Nudist Club site\n\nPinkyMcDrinky\'s Asshole page.\n\nRules of President on the Card Game Heaven site.\nJens Alfke\'s Tahimi page describes a straightforward version with aces high. The name Tahimi is clearly derived from the Japanese "Dai Hin Min" (Very Poor Man), which is the name of one of the Oriental games from which President is descended.\nJean-Franois Bustarret\'s Trou du Cul page (French language)\n\n\nSome further ideas can be found on the President variations page in the Invented Games section of this site.\n\nPresident Software and Online Games\nMalcolm Bain has written a shareware Bum program for Windows.\nA free President computer program lyse can be downloaded from Vincent Brevart\'s web site.\nCommercial Versions\n\nThere are several commercially produced versions of President / Asshole using special cards - for example The Great Dalmuti (described further on the Commercial Games page) and Karriere Poker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Climbing games > President\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1996, 1997, 2004, 2014.

The chips paid for a card are not bets in the ordinary sense: they do not have to be matched or called by the other players. They are fixed prices, paid by a player to the pot, over and above the normal betting process.\nBuy Your Card / Substitution\nIn this variant players can pay to exchange cards for better ones. The maximum number of players is six.\nThe players ante and the dealer deals five cards to each player: two face down and three face up. Players look at their face-down cards. The dealer deals a row of three more cards face up and places the undealt deck face down at the end of the row. The face-up card furthest from the deck costs 1 unit, the middle face-up card 2 units, the card next to the deck 3 units and the unknown top card of the deck 4 units, where 1 unit is equal to the ante and the minimum bet.\nThis is a high-low game with declaration. There are three rounds of buying, each followed by a round of betting.\nA buying round begins with the first active player to the left of the dealer and goes once around the table clockwise. At your turn you have three options:\n\nBuy a card. You discard one card from your hand and buy one of the four cards on offer to replace it, paying the appropriate amount to the pot. If you buy the top card of the face down deck, you look at it but keep it face down, even if you are replacing a face-up card. If you buy a face-up card you keep it face up if it replaces a face-up card from your hand, but turn it face down if it replaces one of your hole cards (even though the other players in fact know what it is). Players should always have at least two cards face-down and may have more.\nStand pat. You buy no card and keep your hand as it is.\nFold. You throw away your cards face down and take no more part in the hand. There is not really any point in doing this, since you could equally well fold in the following betting round.\n\nWhen a face-up card is bought, the dealer replaces it with a new face-up card which will be offered at the same price. If the last player in a buying round buys a face-up card, it is not replaced until after the ensuing betting round.\nThe betting round that follows each buying round is begun by the player who at that time has the best hand showing.\nAfter the third and last betting round the surviving players declare high, low or both before the showdown.\nSubstitution\nIn this variant, playable by up to 10 players, cards are not offered for sale but simply dealt to the players. As in Buy Your Card / Substitution each player is dealt two hole cards and three up cards, and there are three rounds of substitution, each followed by a betting round.\nIn a substitution round, each player in turn either stands pat or discards a card and is dealt a replacement card. If a hole card is discarded the replacement is dealt face down; if a face-up card is discarded, it is replaced by a new card dealt face up. Each betting round is begun by the player with the highest hand showing.\nSurviving players declare high, low or both before the showdown.\nAbyssinia\nIn this five card stud high-low variant players start with no cards and buy known or unknown cards to form their hand.\nThe players place their ante and the dealer turns up two cards and places them one each side of the face down deck. Starting with the player to dealer\'s left, each player in turn may choose to buy either one of the face up cards or the unknown top card of the face down deck. The price depends on the ran of the card - for example 2-5: 2 units, 6-K: 1 unit, ace: 4 units. If a card is bought from the deck it is dealt face up so that its price can be paid. After a face up card is bought, the top card of the deck is turned face up to replace it.\n After everyone has bought their first card there is a round of betting, begun by the player to dealer\'s left. The process is repeated four more times, so that each player who has not folded has five cards. The highest and lowest hands split the pot. \nThis game could be played with all players\' hands face up throughout, since in theory everyone knows what cards everyone has. Alternatively the players can pick up the cards as they buy them and hold them as a concealed hand. In this case the  fifth round of buying cards could be followed by a final betting round and declaration of high, low or both, though if the players have perfect memories they will already know who has won.    \nThe Price is Right\nThis is a seven-card stud high-low game for three to seven players in which everyone starts with two down-cards and buys the remainder.\nAfter players have placed their ante, the dealer deals two cards face down to each player: players may look at their cards. The dealer places  two cards face up on the table side by side with the face-down deck next to them. The upcard further from the deck costs 1 unit, the upcard nearer the deck costs 2 units and the unknown top card of the deck costs three units.\nEach player in turn, beginning with the player to the dealer\'s left, must either fold or  purchase \tone of the three cards on offer. Face-up cards remain face up; if the top card of the deck is bought, the buyer looks at it and keeps it face down, unknown to the other players. If the cheaper face-up card is bought, the dearer card slides over to replace it and a new card is turned up for the 2-unit position. If the dearer face-up card is bought it is replaced by turning up the top card of the deck. After everyone has had the chance to buy, there is a round of betting begun by the player with the best hand showing. \nThis is repeated until the final round of betting when everyone has seven cards. The players then declare high low or both and there is a showdown.\nVariation: this game can be played with three upcards costing 1, 2 and 3 units and the face down card costing 4.\nAuction\nThis is another seven-card high-low game. After antes are placed the dealer deals two cards face down to each player, which they may look at.\nThe dealer now deals face up to the table as many cards as there are players. Everyone simultaneously chooses how much to bid and holds that value of chips in a closed fist. Everyone must bid at least the amount of the minimum bet, and a maximum bid may also be agreed. On a signal from the delaer all players open their hands and reveal their bids. The player who bid highest chooses one of the face up cards and adds it to his or her hand face up; then the next highest bidder does the same and so on, the lowest bidder getting the last card. In case of a tie, the player with the higher poker hand showing goes first; if the hands are also equal, the player nearer to dealer\'s left has priority. All the bids are added to the pot. \nThis procedure is repeated four more times. When everyone has seven cards, there is a betting round. The surviving players then declare high, low or both and there is a showdown.\nGrocery Store Dots\nThis is a seven-card stud game. "Dots" are the pips in the centre column of each card: aces, fives, sevens and nines have one dot; twos, eights and tens have 2 dots, threes have three dots and fours, sixes and picture cards have no dots. The pot is split between the highest five-card hand and the player whose seven cards have most dots.\nAfter everyone has placed their ante, the dealer deals two hole cards and one upcard to each player as in seven-card stud, and the first betting round takes place. \nThe dealer then sets out the "grocery store" consisting of a row of three face up cards on the table, and marks the leftmost card by placing a chip or other marker on it. This card costs 1 unit, the card next to it 2 units and the third card 3 units. From now on, a player who is about to be dealt a card from the deck has the option to buy a card from the grocery store instead, placing the appropriate price in chips in the pot. A player who chooses not to buy is dealt a card from the deck as normal. \nIf a card is bought, the store is restocked from the deck immediately before the next purchase decision. That means that if the dealer buys a card, the store is not restocked until after the betting round that follows.\nWhen everyone has four upcards the remaining store stock is discarded, After the betting round, a final card is dealt to each player face down, and there is a final betting round foolowed by a showdown in which the high hand and the player with most dots split the pot.\nWall Street\nThis seven card stud game is similar to The Price is Right, with the difference that there are four face up cards on sale, and a player who does not wish to buy any of them is dealt a free card face up from the deck.\nThe dealer deals two cards face down and one face up  to each player, and a row of  four cards \tface up to the table. These cards are called Wall Street, and the card at one end of the row is marked with a chip. There is a round of betting, begun by the player with the highest card showing.\nNow each player in turn starting to dealer\'s left acquires another upcard. The card can be bought from Wall Street: the card marked with a chip costs 1 unit and the others cost 2, 3 and 4 units respectively. The price is paid to the pot. A player does not want to buy from Wall Street is dealt a card face up from the deck. Immediately before each purchase decision, any empty position in Wall Street is filled by dealing a new card from the deck. After everyone has their new card there is a betting round, begun by the player with the highest hand showing. Note that if the last player bought from Wall Street, there will only be three cards showing during the betting round, since Wall Street is not replenished until the beginning of the next buying round.\nThe process is repeated two more times, so that everyone has four up cards. The unsold Wall Street stock is then discarded. After the ensuing betting round a card is dealt face down to each player. There is a then final betting round after which players declare high, low or both and the high and low winners split the pot.  \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Buy Your Card\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2011.

Within this game, there are all the possible versions of the Draw game.\nEquipment\nThe game uses a double six domino set, but other sets can also be used when you have more players.  Players will also need some poker chips.\nThe Deal\nThe size of the hand varies with the number of players:\n\n\n2 players get 7 tiles each\n3 players get 7 tiles each\n4 players get 6 tiles each\n\nThe rest of the tiles stay in the boneyard.\n\nThe Play\nAt the start of each round, all the players put an equal stake into a pool, usually three chips.  The players draw for the lead and take turns placing tiles on either end of the train.  Doubles are played across the line, but are not spinners.\nIf a player cannot play, he can either pass or buy tiles from the boneyard.  He can buy as many tiles as he wishes, each tile costs one chip.  If the boneyard down to two tiles, then nobody can buy further tiles.\nWhen the boneyard is reduced to two tiles, the player who follows the player who bought the tiles that caused the boneyard to be reduced to two tiles becomes the auctioneer and announces that the last two tiles are on auction.\nStarting with the auctioneer, each player bids on the last two tiles.  Bids go around the table twice (i.e. each player gets to make two bids) and the highest bid gets the last two tiles and has to put the amount of his bid into the pool.  A bid can be for zero (announced as "check") or more chips, but each bid must be larger than the bid before it.\nIf nobody bids on the last two tiles, then they stay in the boneyard and are not used in the round.\nThe hand stops when one player dominoes or when nobody can play.  The lead then passes to the next player in turn for the next round.\nScoring\nThe player who dominoes wins the pool.  If the game blocked, then each player totals the number of pips in his hands.  The player with the lowest total is the winner and collects the entire pool.  If there is a tie for lowest total, then the pool is split equally among the winning players. Any odd amount is left in the pool for the next round.\nComments & Strategy\nSee the basic Draw game for variations in the hands, and other features of the game.\nA common variation is not to have an auction for the last two tiles and simply leave them in the boneyard.  This game is called Domino Pool in England.\nThe best play is to play your strongest suit, preferably with a double, so that you will have more options for further plays when it is your turn again.  The better control you have of a suit, the more you should try to leave that suit on the ends of the train.\nDo not to get carried away with buying tiles and do not go nuts at the auction.  You can pay out a lot of chips and stick yourself with a large hand that will lose the round for you. \nOn the other hand, if you can count the suits on the table, you can buy tiles to prevent other players from getting them and lock them out of play while you take control.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Western Domino Games > Auction Draw Dominoes\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net).\n      \n       Joe Celko 2001.

The domino chapter of Verstand und Glck im Bunde (F. Tendler, Vienna, 1830) describes a draw game for two to six players with this set, and according to Domino in vielen Spielarten by Fritz Beck (Pechans Perlen Reihe, Vienna, 1960) this was still the case in the mid 20th century. About 90% of Beck\'s book is devoted to games with the [8-8] set, usually  reduced to 36 tiles by discarding all the doubles, and there are only a few pages at the end describing games with the [6-6] set. A report of these [8-8] games in English, probably based on Beck, appears in Domino Games and Puzzles by K. W. H. Leeflang (Amsterdam 1972; New York 1975).\nEquipment\nAccording to Beck, dominoes in Austria are normally sold as double eight sets with 45 tiles. That was in 1960: I don\'t know whether it is still true today, but Alexey Lobashev tells me that he has seen 45-tile sets on sale in Hungary. For the game  the nine doubles are normally removed, leaving 36 tiles.  If an original double eight set is not available, this set can be made  from a double nine set by removing 19 tiles.\nThe Deal\nTwo or three players can play a draw game: two players get 8 or 9 each tiles; three players get 7 tiles each.\nFour players play as individuals with 7 or 8 tiles each. This is a block game in which the boneyard (Stamm or Talon) of 8 or 12 tiles is not used. Three can also play a block game taking 8 or 9 tiles each, and two players take 11 or 12 each.\nThe Play\nThe tableau is not played in a line, but as a double line, with the matching end placed on the side of the tile to which it matches.  It looks like a row of bricks - the illustration to the right is from Beck\'s Domino in vielen Spielarten.\nWhen playing a  draw game, a player who is unable to play draws tile from the boneyard until able to do so. It is sometimes agreed that a player can draw only up to three tiles in this way, and that if unable to play after drawing three tiles the player must pass.\nWhen a block game is played, a player who cannot play simply passes and the undealt tiles remain unused and unknown.\nFor the first round the first player is the holder of the heaviest tile - the [8-7] if it is in play, otherwise the [8-6] and so on. The winner of the each round leads in the next round. \nScoring\nThe first player to domino wins.  If the game blocks, the player with the fewer total pips on the tiles in his hand wins.  If players tie for lowest, then there is no winner and the player who set the last tile leads the next round.\nBuki\nAccording to Beck this four-player variant was considered a gambling game under Austrian law and therefore officially prohibited. He nevertheless devotes 20 pages to it, with advice on play and an example game. It is a block game using 36 tiles (no doubles) in which each player takes 6 tiles, leaving a Stamm of 12 tiles. \nBefore the game, one of the four players is chosen as the banker for the session, and the minimum and maximum stake must be agreed. It seems that a ratio of 3:1 between the maximum and minimum is about right. A small difference between maximum and minimum gives an advantage to the banker and a large difference an advantage to the other players. After shuffling, the players take their six tiles each and the banker lays out the Stamm in three columns of four tiles as shown in the diagram, where player D is the banker:\n\nThese undealt tiles of the Stamm are not used in the game, but provide the positions where the players A, B and C place their bets. Note that it appears from the diagram - taken from Beck\'s book - that this game was sometimes played counter-clockwise. Beck recommends that the direction of play be reversed from time to time, for example after every five or ten games, so that a player is not always playing immediately after the same opponent.\nEach of the players other than the banker must place a stake before his third turn in the game. The player chooses the amount of the stake, depending on what he considers are his chances of winning, but it must be not less than the agreed minimum and not more than the maximum. At the end of the play, the winner retrieves his stake and is paid two and a half times his stake by the banker. The banker collects the stakes of the other players. If the banker wins, he collects all the players\' stakes. If a player other than the banker wins, this player must place his stake at the start of the following game, before setting his first tile.\nExample. With a minimum stake of 2 and a maximum of 6, player A stakes 4, player B 2 and player C 6. If A wins he keeps his 4 and receives 10 from D so the net result is A: +10, B: -2, C: -6, D: -2. If B wins the result is A: -4, B: +5, C: -6, D: +5. If C wins the result is A: -4, B: -2, C: +15, D: -9. If D wins the result is A: -4, B: -2, C: -6, D: +12.  \nIf the game is blocked, the player with the lowest pip count in his unplayed tiles wins as usual. If there is a tie for lowest pip count, the players\' stakes remain on the table. In the next game, players may add to their stakes (up to the maximum) but cannot reduce them.\nSome play that any player may ask to increase his stake any time until his fourth turn, but the banker is free to accept or refuse such a request.\nThis game was often played with spectators, who must sit so that they can only see one players hand. Spectators are not allowed to comment on or interfere with the play in any way, but can ask to place a bet on the player they are watching to win. The banker is not obliged to accept spectators\' bets, and may choose to accept some bets and not others.\nVariation. Buki was often played with seven tiles each and a Stamm of 8 tiles. With fewer tiles out of play there is more scope for skill. The banker places the Stamm in a single row of eight tiles. His neighbours place their bets at the ends of the row nearest them and the player opposite the banker places his bet in the middle of the row. The rules of play and payments are exactly the same as for Buki with six tiles.\nPulle\nThis is another block game for four players using 36 tiles and taking seven tiles each. Before the game each player contributes an equal stake to the pool (Pulle). At the end of the play, whether blocked or not, all players count the pip total on their unplayed tiles and add this to their running score. A player whose score is more than 100 is eliminated from the game, and the last surviving player collects contents of the pool. Note that if you have 100 you are still alive - only a player with 101 or more is knocked out.\nThat is the basic game, but it is complicated by the possibility of buying back  (zurckkaufen). After any game, a player may pay half the initial stake to the pot, and his score is then adjusted to be equal to the middle score of the other three players. This is possible even for a player whose score has just gone over 100. For example, if after a game the scores are A:107, B:94, C: 68, D:50, A can either drop out of the game or "buy back" for a half stake, reducing his score to 68. At this point B could also pay a half stake into the pool to reduce his score to 68 as well. If the other players\' scores are all equal, then a player who buys back gets a score that is one greater - for example if the scores are 99:70:70:70 then the player with 99 will have his score reduced to 71 if he buys back.\nIt can happen that a blocked game ends with everyone having 101 or more points. This is known as a "broken pool" (gesprengte Pulle). Everyone\'s score is set back to zero, everyone pays the initial stake into the pool again, and you carry on playing.\nOften the game is played in such a way that as well as playing for the pool the winner of each individual game wins a certain amount from each of the other players. In this case the winner of a blocked  game wins half as much as a player who dominoes (plays his last tile). Beck gives an example in which each player pays 3.00 to the pool initially, buying back costs 1.50 to the pool, and the winner of each game receives 1.00 from each opponent, or 0.50 each if the game is blocked. In the case of a blocked game where the players tie for lowest score, there is no payment for the game, and the players\' pip totals are not added to their running scores.\nOther Web Pages\nThe German Wikipedia page Bukidomino has more information on the history of Buki and an illustration of a game in progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Western Domino Games > Austrian Dominoes\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net) and is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       Joe Celko, John McLeod 2001, 2011.

Whoever collects most sets wins. The basic idea is very simple and they are often thought of as children\'s games.\nSo far as I know, games of this type first appeared in the mid 19th century and were played with special cards. In Britain there was  Spade the Gardener, in which players collect families of five cards, later superseded by Happy Families, in which each family consists of four cards (mother, father, son, daughter).  In the USA, the game of Dr Busby, also based on families, was first published in 1843, followed by Authors in 1861. I do not know whether these games were based on an earlier game played with standard cards, or whether the adaptation to use a standard pack came later.\nGo Fish\n\nThis game is often just known as Fish, but the name "Fish" (or Canadian Fish or Russian Fish) is also sometimes used for the more complex partnership game Literature. Go Fish is best for 3-6 players, but it is possible for 2 to play. A standard 52 card deck is used. The dealer deals 5 cards to each player (7 each for 2 players). The remaining cards are placed face down to form a stock.\n\nThe player to dealer\'s left starts. A turn consists of asking a specific player for a specific rank. For example, if it is my turn I might say: \'Mary, please give me your jacks\'. The player who asks must already hold at least one card of the requested rank, so I must hold at least one jack to say this. If the player who was asked (Mary) has cards  of the named rank (jacks in this case), she must give all her cards of this rank to the player who asked for them. That player then gets another turn and may again ask any player for any rank already held by the asker.\n\nIf the person asked does not have any cards of the named rank, they say \'Go fish!\'. The asker must then draw the top card of the undealt stock. If the drawn card is the rank  asked for, the asker shows it and gets another turn. If the drawn card is not the rank asked for, the asker keeps it, but the turn now passes to the player who said \'Go fish!\'.\n\nAs soon as a player collects a book of 4 cards of the same rank, this must be shown and discarded face down. The game continues until either someone has no cards left in their hand or the stock runs out. The winner is the player who then has the most books.\n\n\nVariations of Go Fish\n\nSome people play that rather than asking for a rank, you must ask for a specific card. You must already hold at least one card of that rank. For example, you say: \'Tom, please give me the seven of diamonds\'. If Tom has it he gives it and you get another turn. If he doesn\'t, he says \'Go Fish!\' and you draw from the stock. In the unlikely event that you draw the seven of diamonds you get another turn; if you draw anything else it is now Tom\'s turn.\n\nIf you play this variation, you need to agree whether it is permissible to ask for a card which you already hold in your hand. Obviously you\'ll have to fish and your turn will end, but you might do this deliberately to mislead the other players into thinking that you didn\'t hold that card.\n\nSome people play that when the stock runs out, you carry on playing until all the cards have been made into books. Obviously after the stock has run out there is no \'Go Fish!\'. If the person you asked doesn\'t have the card asked for, the turn passes directly to them.\n\nSome people play that when a player runs out of cards, the play does not end, but the player draws a new hand of 5 cards from the stock (or the whole stock if fewer than 5 cards remain there).\n\nSome people play that after a player fishes unsuccessfully, the turn passes to the left, rather than to the player who said "go fish".\n\nThere are various ways of scoring. For example, you may play a series of hands, scoring one point for each book you make. The game continues until someone wins by reaching an agreed target score - for example, 10 points.\n\n\nA few people  score according to the cards in the books, for example 2-10 face value, 11 for jacks, 12 for queens, 13 for kings, 15 for aces.\nAustralian Fish\nPaul Gardner-Stephen reports that in Australia a variant is often played in which the object is to collect pairs. 7 cards are dealt to each player from a 52-card pack. The player with most pairs plays first. At your turn you ask for a card matching one you have in your hand. All pairs must be put down as soon as they are obtained - you cannot hoard a pair in hand as a basis for asking for the other two matching cards. A player who runs out of cards draws a new hand of 7 cards from the undealt stock. Play continues until everyone has run out of cards, and players score a point for each pair they have made. \nThis game is sometimes played with special cards, and sometimes with a 54-card pack including two jokers, which act as normal cards forming a pair.  Jonny Groves describes a similar game played in the USA, and suggests that a pair of jokers should be scored as 2 points rather than 1 since it is harder to make than other pairs. For similar reasons, collecting two pairs of the same rank should score 3 points rather than 2.\nA variant Backstab Fish is played in Adelaide with 108 cards including four jokers. There are 4-10 players, 7 cards each are dealt and the aim is to make sets of four equal cards, suits being ignored. At your turn you ask a specific player for a specific number of cards of a rank of which you hold at least one: for example you could ask a player for three sixes if you hold a six. The player gives you the exact number of cards you asked for, if she has them: if not - for example if she only has two sixes - you have to draw a card from the stock and the turn passes to the player you asked. In this game you are not required to lay down four of a kind. You can keep them as a basis for asking for more cards of that rank, but if you do not put them down you may lose some or all of them if another player asks for them.\nOmben / Minuman\nThe Indonesian version of Go Fish is known as Omben in Javanese or Minuman in Indonesian, both names meaning "drink". It is said to be best for two players, each of whom begins with a hand of 4 or 5 cards (according to agreement) drawn from a 52 card pack. The players take turns to ask their opponent for a  rank, such as 8 or king, and the opponent must give the asker all cards of that rank that he or she holds. If the opponent has no such card the asker must "drink" by  drawing cards from the pile of undealt cards: the asker continues to  draw until he or she finds a card of the rank that was asked for. Whenever a player has  four of a kind in hand, it must be discarded face up. The winner is the first player to get rid of all their cards - it does not matter how many or few sets they have made. If the stock runs out, the player with fewer cards is the winner. Note that in this game the players ask alternately, irrespective of whether the card asked for is found in the other player\'s hand or the draw pile.\nAuthors\n\nThis is Go Fish without the stock pile. All the cards are dealt out as equally as possible to the players. A turn consists of asking a player for a rank (or a specific card if you play that version). If they have it your turn continues; if not the turn passes to the player you asked. As in Go Fish, you must have a card of the rank you asked for. Books of 4 cards are discarded. The game continues until all the cards are formed into books, and whoever gets most books wins - or you can score one point per book and play to a target score.\n\n\nThis game is called Authors in the USA, because it was originally played with special educational cards showing pictures of famous authors. These cards are still available and the idea has been extended to cards showing inventors, American presidents, explorers, baseball players and many other themes. A selection of different types of Authors cards is available from from funagain.com\n\n\n\n\nVIEW THE WHOLE RANGE\nHappy Families\nThis British version of the game is played with a special pack of 44 cards depicting the mother, father, son and daughter of eleven families. Everyone contributes equally to a pool, all the cards are dealt, and the player to dealer\'s left begins. The player whose turn it is asks another player for a specific card; the asker must already hold at least one card of the same family. If the player asked has the card it must be handed over and the asker continues by asking the same or another player for another card. If the asked player does not have the wanted card they say "not at home" and the turn passes to them. Completed families are placed face down in front of the owner. When all families are complete, the player with most wins half the pool.\nThe game then continues into a second phase, in which players ask for complete families. The winner of the first phase begins, and the player who manages to accumulate all eleven families wins the second half of the pool.\nSome play a version in which a player asking for a card must say "please", and a player receiving a card must say "thank you". Anyone who forgets to do this must give back the requested card (if it has been handed over) and the turn passes to the player they were asking.\nIn the French Jeu des Sept Familles each family has six members including two grandparents, so that the seven families make up a 42-card pack.\nPi Hng ()\nThis Thai game, whose name means "room card", is essentially the same as Happy Families. It is played by 3 to 6 players using a standard 52-card pack. All the cards are dealt out as evenly as possible, and the aim is to collect fours of a kind. The player next to the dealer who received the first card in the deal begins. At your turn you ask another player for a specific card by rank and suit (e.g. 6 of diamonds): in order to ask for a card you must have a card of that rank in your hand. If the player you asked has the requested card you receive it and your turn continues. If not, the turn passes to the player you asked. A set of four equal cards is called a room (hng): a player who collects one of these can store the cards face down or keep them in hand. The game ends when all 13 rooms have been collected, and the player with most rooms wins.\nQuartett\nThis is the German equivalent of Happy Families or Authors. Quartett can be played with a standard 32-card pack (A-K-D-B-10-9-8-7), as used for the German national game Skat. However, this is not longer usual as a huge variety of special Quartett packs are available. These mostly also consist of eight quartets and therefore 32 cards.Many different designs of cards have been made for this game from the late nineteenth to the present day, with various educational or other themes. German Quartett cards are often provided with technical statistics related to the theme of the pack, so that they can also be used to play Top Trumps, which in German is sometimes known as Supertrumpf, and sometimes include a Schwarzer Peter (Black Peter) card so that they can be used for the German equivalent of Old Maid.\n Three or More Players\nThe cards are thoruoghly shuffled and dealt out to the players one at a time clockwise. Some players will have one more card than others, but this does not matter. The player to dealer\'s left begins by asking any other player for a specific card: "Heini, do you have the king of hearts?".\nThe player asking for a card must already hold at least one card of the same quartet. If the player who is hasked has the requested card, it must be given to the player who asked, who can then ask the same or another player for another card. If the player who is asked does not have the requested card, then the turn passes to that player, who now asks any player for a card. Whenever a player collects a complete quartet (four cards of the same rank when using standard cards), these are placed face up on the table. If this leaves the player without cards, the turn to ask passes to the next player to the left.\nThe winner is the player who has most quartets when all the cards have been laid down.\nTwo Players\nEach player is dealt a hand of 10 cards and the remaining 12 cards are stacked face down on the table. A  player who does not have the requested card draws one card from the stock before asking the opponent for a card. The remaining rules are the same as in the three-player game.\n Quartett Cards\n Many Quartett packs with various themes have been published. The variety is so great as to give ther impression that  they are seen more as picture books or as collectible objects than as cards for a game. Leonhard Stork\'s catalogue Spielzeit  Bestimmungshandbuch fr Quartett- und  Peterspiele von 1880 bis heute (Playtime - identification handbook for Quartett and Black Peter cards from 1880 to the present), published in August 2000 and now out of print, lists 4800 different German Quartett and Black Peter packs. The interested collector can however obtain several illustrated catalogues by the same author covering particular themes - these can be ordered from amazon.com. Modern Quartett decks sometimes have quite strange themes, such as suicide (Selbstmordquartett) and worse - see www.quartett.net.\nGerman Quartett cards are often provided with technical statistics  related to the theme of the pack, so that they can also be used to play Top Trumps, which in German is sometimes known as Supertrumpf, and sometimes include a Schwarzer Peter (Black Peter) card so that they can be used for the German equivalent of Old Maid.\nOther Web Pages and Software\nThe site Cribbage.ca has a description of a French Canadian variation known as Merci, which is similar to Go Fish except that 10 cards each are dealt, and a player who forgets to say "merci" (thank you) when being given the requested cards must return the cards and the turn passes to the player who was asked.\nThe collection \nHOYLE Card Games for Windows or Mac OS X  includes a Go Fish program, along with many other popular card games.\nRobert Schultz\'s World of Card Games offers an online Go Fish game.\nThe Softgame Company\'s Funcrd Card Games program plays hearts, Spades, Cribbage and Go Fish.\nAt SolitaireOnline.com you can play Go Fish or Quartet on line against the server.\nMike\'s Cards includes a Go Fish program for Macintosh and Windows computers.\nGames4All has published a free Go Fish app for the Android platform, and also a SugarKidsClub version for the Dutch diabetes association DVN.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Quartet Group > Go Fish / Quartet\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1996, 2003, 2012.

John McLeod taught Anthony Smith, who has written the following description.\n\n\nIntroduction\nPlayers and  Cards\nThe Deal\nThe Tricks\nOne or More Sevens is Turned\n    \n\nTrumps and Declarer - The Game - Scoring\n\n\nNo Seven is Exposed\n    \n\nTrumps and Declarer - The Game - Scoring\n\n\nEnding the Match\nSources\nRemarks\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Lithuanian game Avinas ("Rams" in English)   is especially popular around the town of Jurbarkas\n(on the river Niemen, between Kaunas and the western border).\nOn holidays players left off playing only to go to Mass.\n\nIt is clearly a relative of Schafkopf, Sjavs and similar games, not only because of the values of the cards, the promotion of the queens and jacks to be the highest trumps and the ranking of the suits, but also because of the sheep associations of its name.\nPlayers and Cards\nAvinas is a\ntrick-taking game for two pairs of players. Each player sits opposite\nhis partner. Deal and play are clockwise.\n\nA 32 card pack is used, ranking\n\nin trumps: QC, 7, QS, QH, QD, JC, JS, JH, JD, A, 10, K, 9, 8\n\nin other suits: A, 10, K, 9, 8, 7.\n\nThe cards are valued at A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2 in all suits, giving a total of 120 points in the pack.\n\nAce, King, Queen, Jack are Tuzas, Karalius, Dama, Valetas in Lithuanian and Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds are Kryziai, Vynai, Cirvai, Bugnai.\n\nQC is called "s\'pic" and QS is called "green". In some parts of Lithuania some players call Queens "uppers" and call Jacks "lowers" [which suggests that Avinas was once played with German suited cards].\n\nThe Deal\nA match consists of several hands. \n\nAt the start of each hand the dealer deals in fours, clockwise. He exposes the fourth and eighth card of each opponent. He also examines the fourth and eighth of his own and his partner\'s cards, but only exposes any that are sevens. The game takes different forms according to whether or not any sevens have been exposed.\n\n\nThe turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nThe Tricks\n\nHow Declarer is determined depends on whether or not any seven was exposed during the deal, but Declarer always leads to the first trick.\n\nThe lead to the first trick must be a trump. The winner of the first trick must lead a trump to the second trick if he holds one. If he has none he leads a card face down or face up as he chooses. If it is face down he indicates to his partner by a facial expression whether it is a valuable card or not. The other players\nfollow as if a trump had been led, and the highest trump played wins the trick. If the card led was face-down then when all four have played it is exposed.\n\nTricks are played as in Whist, that is, suit must be followed if possible and a player void in the suit led may trump or discard as he chooses. The winner of one trick leads to the next.\n\nOne or More Sevens is Turned\nDeterming the Trump Suit and the Declarer\n\nIt can be expected that in over 70% of the deals at least one seven will be turned. If just one of the exposed cards is a seven then its suit is trumps; if more than one is a seven then the suit of the seven which was dealt last is the trump suit. The player who was dealt the seven of trumps is Declarer and will lead to the first trick.\n\n\nThe Game\n\nNormally all eight tricks are played out and Declarer and his partner have won if they took at least 61 points but lost if they took 60 or fewer.\n\n\nHowever, before the lead to the first trick, Declarer or his partner may undertake to win all the tricks, by knocking on the table. This doubles the value of the game. Either defender may then knock on the table, which doubles the value of the game again. In these cases Declarer and his partner have lost as soon as the defenders take a trick.\n\n Scoring the Game\n\n  The result of the game will be marked on the score sheet as circles called "Rams".\n  \n\nIf Declarer and his partner win the basic game then the defenders are penalised with 1, 2, 3 or 4 Rams according as 1, 2, 3 or 4 sevens were exposed during the deal. If they lose then they are penalised with 2, 4, 6 or 8 Rams.\n\nIf Declarer or his partner knocked and succeeded in taking all eight tricks then their opponents are penalised with 2, 4, 6 or 8 Rams, but if they failed to take all the tricks they are penalised with 4, 8, 12 or 16 Rams according as 1, 2, 3 or 4 sevens were exposed during the deal.\n\nIf Declarer or his partner knocked and an opponent also knocked then the defenders are penalised with 4, 8, 12 or 16 Rams if Declarer and his partner take all the tricks but Declarer and his partner are penalised with 8, 16, 24 or 32 Rams if they fail to take all the tricks.\n\nA penalty Ram is marked on the score sheet by cancelling a Ram of the opponents if possible, or by drawing a circle if the opponents have no uncancelled Rams. Thus at most one side has any Rams at any time.\n\n\n\nNo Seven is Exposed\n Determining the trump Suit and the Declarer\n\nIn can be expected that in over 29% of deals no seven will be turned. In such a case the player at the dealer\'s left either passes or names the length (but not the suit) of a trump suit he can make. The other players in turn then either pass or state a longer length. If all pass then there is a new deal, by the next dealer. Otherwise the player stating the longest length becomes Declarer and leads to the first trick. If is found that Declarer held a shorter trump suit than he claimed then he and his partner are deemed to have lost the match.\n\nNotice that it is lawful to state a length of possible trump suit while holding another longer suit.\n\n The Game\n\nDeclarer does not name trumps but simply leads one. If the lead to the first trick is a Queen or a Jack, so that it is not clear what the trump suit is, the player on Declarer\'s left must ask what the trump suit is.\n\nWhen no seven was turned it is not necessary to play all the tricks. Declarer or his partner can stop the game at any stage. If they have at least 61 points then they have won, and the defenders are penalised as in 6.3. If they have fewer than 61 then they have lost, even if they have more points than their opponents, and are penalised as in 6.3.\n\n Scoring the Game\n\nThe result of the game will be marked on the score sheet with Pips called "writing" (see diagram). \n\nIf Declarer and his partner make at least 61 points and the defenders have 31 or more then 1 Pip is marked against the defenders. \n\nIf Declarer and his partner make at least 61 and the defenders have at least 2 but fewer than 31 then 2 Pips are marked against the defenders.\n\nIf Declarer and his partner make least 61 and the defenders have taken no points then 3 Pips are marked against the defenders.\n\nIf Declarer and his partner have less than 60 but at least 31 points then 2 Pips are marked against Declarer and his partner.\n\nIf Declarer and his partner have at least 2 but fewer than 31 points then 4 Pips are marked against Declarer and his partner.\n\nIf Declarer and his partner have taken no points then 6 Pips are marked against Declarer and his partner.\n\nKeeping the opponents\' score below 31 is called "taking the field", but there is no special name for preventing the opponents from taking any points.\n\nPenalty Pips are not cancelled like Rams are.\n\n Ending the Match\n\nAfter each game the player on the left of the old dealer deals for a new game, until one side scores at least 12 penalty Pips. Play then ends. If the other side then have no Pips then the players who had the 12 Pips have been made "Cats" and are disgraced until the next game. Traditionally there is no more play that day, and new cards are used for the next game.\n\nIf both sides have penalty Pips then the Pips are ignored and the side which has more penalty Rams has lost. In the diagram, the match has just ended because E & W have 12 pips. E & W win because N & S have eight Rams.\n\nIf neither side has any Ram at this stage then the side with fewer penalty Pips wins.\n\nThe stakes can be an agreed flat rate for the match or can be an agreed figure per Ram on the final score sheet.\nSources\n\nDemonstration games played with Albinas Borisevicius at IPCS Munich, November 1991\nRule-sheet sent by Albinas Borisevicius to John McLeod \nAnswers of 14 May 1992 by Albinas Borisevicius to queries of 21 March 1992 by John McLeod\n\nRemarks\n\nMr Borisevicius considers "Ram" the best English for the name of the game and "Hammel" the best German. Unfortunately "Hammel" means "wether", not "ram".\nIt can be good tactics for both sides to wish to lose a "no seven" game! Suppose one side has no Rams and 11 pips while the other side has both one or more Rams and one or more pips. Then the players on 11 wish to lose so as to bring this to at least 12 and so end the match while their opponents have Rams; their opponents can avoid this only by themselves losing. (Mr Borisevicius confirms this.) Since Declarer\'s side in a "no seven" game can choose when to bring the game to a close, they can certainly arrange to lose; thus there will be no underbidding for the right to be Declarer! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Schafkopf group > Avinas\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1995, 2015.

It is an expanded version of sishi fen (\'40 points\') using two or more decks, and is related to zhao pengyou (\'looking for friends\'). All these games are collectively known as Sheng1 Ji2 (), which means "raise level" or "promote". Tractor is widely popular in China, especially in Shanghai and south of the Yellow River where it has practically displaced the older single deck game.\nPlayers and Cards\nThere are four players in two fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other. A double deck of standard international cards is used, with four jokers - two red and two black. There are 108 cards in the deck altogether. (For versions with more than four players and more than two decks see variations.\nThe object of the game is to win tricks containing kings, tens and fives. Kings and tens are worth 10 points each, fives are worth 5 points each, and all other cards are worthless. There are 200 points in the pack in total.\nUsually, the jokers, all cards of a particular suit and all cards of a particular rank are trumps. The highest trumps are the red jokers, then the black jokers, then the cards that belong to both the trump suit and the trump rank, then the other cards of the trump rank (all equal), then the remaining cards of the trump suit in descending order from ace to two. In the other suits, the cards rank from ace (high) down to two (low) omitting the trump rank. \nFor example, if sevens and clubs are trumps, the trumps from high to low are: red joker, black joker, 7, other sevens (equal in rank), A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nThe cards in each of the other suits rank: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nNote that for the purposes of the play, the cards of the trump rank count as belonging to the trump suit, not to the suits marked on them. The jokers also belong to the trump suit.\nIn some deals there is no trump suit. In that case the only trumps are the four jokers, red jokers beating black jokers. The cards of all four non-trump suits rank from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nDeclarers and opponents: the scores and the objective\nThe scores of the teams are expressed as card ranks. At the start of the game, each partnership has the lowest possible score, which is two. By winning games, a partnership can increase its score to a higher rank: three, four, five and so on. Above ten come jack, queen, king and ace. The objective is to achieve a score higher than ace - the partnership that achieves this wins the game.\nIn each hand, one team are the declarers, sometimes known in Chinese as dang1 zhuang1 (), and the other team are the opponents. (In a previous version of this page the teams were called "attackers" and "defenders", but it has become clear that some players use these words in the exact opposite sense to the one used here. Hopefully "declarers" and "opponents" will avoid ambiguity.) In the first hand, either team can by declarers, depending on who makes trumps. In subsequent hands, the team that won the previous hand are the declarers, and the other team are the opponents.\nOne member of the declarers\' team is the starter, who has the advantage of taking the last cards in the deal, discarding some cards, and leading to the first trick. While the declarers try to increase their score, the opponents\' objective is to take at least 80 card points, in which case they become the declarers for the next deal.\nThe deal and making trumps\nDeal and play are anticlockwise. The cards are shuffled and stacked face down in the centre of the table. Each player in turn takes a card from the top of the pack, continuing around the table in anticlockwise until each player has 25 cards, leaving 8 cards face down on the table. The players look at the cards they take, adding them to their hands, but not showing them to the other players.\nIn the first hand the trump rank is two. In subsequent hands, the trump rank is equal to the score of the declarers\' team (the team that won the previous hand). Trumps are made during the deal, by a player exposing face up on the table a card of the trump rank, or two identical cards of the trump rank, or two identical jokers. The trump suit is the suit of the exposed card. If identical jokers are exposed, there are no trumps (and the trump rank has no special status in that deal).\nIf you draw a card of the trump rank during the deal, you are not obliged to expose it immediately or at all. You may wait to see more of your hand, so that you can better decide whether you wish to make to make this suit trumps. You may hope that you will later pick up other cards of the trump rank, giving you a choice of suit. However, if another player exposes a trump before you do so, you can no longer make trumps by exposing a single card. After a trump rank card has been exposed, the trump suit can only be changed if another player exposes two identical trump rank cards. The suit of these cards then supersedes the first exposed suit. If a pair of identical trump rank cards has been exposed, the trump suit cannot be changed, but it can be eliminated by another player exposing a pair of identical jokers, so that there will be no trumps except jokers in that hand.\nYou can also make trumps by exposing a pair of identical trump rank cards even if no one has previously exposed a single card, and you can make no trumps by exposing jokers even if no one has tried to make a trump suit or if only a single card has been exposed. If you have already made trumps by exposing a single card, you cannot later change the trump suit yourself by exposing a pair, but you can use a pair to change a trump suit made by your partner with a single card if you wish to. If another player overrules your single exposed trump with a pair, you may in turn overrule their trumps by exposing a pair of jokers for no trumps.\nIn each deal, one member of the declarers\' team is the starter. This player takes the last eight cards, adds them to his or her hand without showing them to the other players, and discards eight cards face down. It can be risky to discard valuable cards, because the point value (if any) of these discarded cards will be doubled (or possibly multiplied by a higher factor) and given to the team that wins the last trick - see scoring. The starter also leads to the first trick.\nIn the first deal, the player who shuffles and takes the first card from the pack is chosen at random. The player who finally makes trumps becomes the starter, and the starter\'s team are the declarers.\nIn subsequent deals, if the declarers won the previous deal, the new starter is the previous starter\'s partner. If the opponents won, becoming the new declarers, the starter is the player to the previous starter\'s right.\nIt sometimes happens that when everyone has taken their 25 cards, no one has yet exposed a card or cards to make trumps. This will happen when the players who have trump rank cards have few other accompanying cards in the same suit, and so do not want the suit as trumps. There is then a pause, to see whether anyone wishes at this stage to expose a trump. If no one wants to, the last eight cards are turned face up one at a time. If a card of the trump rank is found, its suit becomes trumps and no further cards are exposed. If all eight cards are exposed and contain no trump rank card, the trump suit is determined by the highest of these cards (not counting any jokers that may be there). If there are two or more equal highest cards, the first of these that was exposed determines the trump suit. The starter then takes the eight cards as usual and discards eight.\nThe above procedure applies in the second and subsequent hands, where the starter is known before the deal. It is extremely unlikely that in the first hand no one would expose a trump from their 25 cards, because by making trumps your team gains the advantage of being the declarers. If this did happen, the cards would be thrown in and the deal repeated.\nThe play\nAfter discarding eight cards, the starter leads to the first trick. There are four kinds of lead, each of which will be discussed in turn below:\n\nany single card\nany pair of identical cards, played together\na sequence of consecutive pairs of identical cards\na set of top cards\n\nEach of the other players in anticlockwise order around the table must play the same number of cards as were led, following suit as far as possible. Note that the jokers and the trump rank cards count as belonging to the trump suit. The winner of the trick is determined according to the rules set out below for each type of lead. The winner of each trick leads to the next trick, and may again lead a single card, pair, sequence of pairs or top set.\nIf an opponent of the starter wins the trick, any valuable cards (kings, tens and fives) that it contains are placed face up in front of one of the opponents. The remaining cards are placed face down in a waste pile in front of the starter\'s partner - keeping them well separated from the starter\'s discards, which are stored face down in front of the starter. If the declarers\' team wins the trick, all the cards in it are placed face down on the waste pile in front of the starter\'s partner. In this way it is always possible to see by looking at the face up cards in front of the opponents how many points they have so far collected. The total number of card points collected by the opponents determines the result: the opponents win if they have 80 points or more.\n1. Leading a single card\nAny single card may be led. If a trump is led, the other players must play a trump if they have one; anyone who does not have a trump may play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump played; if several equally high trumps are played then first played of the equal trumps beats the others and wins the trick if no higher trump is played.\nIf a non-trump is led, the other players must play a non-trump of the same suit as the lead if they can. Any player who is unable to follow suit in this way may play any card. If no one plays a trump, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led; if equal cards are played, the first played beats the other. If any player plays a trump, the trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if there are several equal highest trumps, by the first of them that was played.\nExamples. Suppose that fives and diamonds are trumps. \n\nThe 5 is led. This is a trump, so each of the other players must play a diamond, a five or a joker if possible. If the cards played to the trick are 5, Q, 10 and 5 in that order, the player of the 5 wins the trick, since this was played before the equally high 5.\nThe 7 is led. This is not a trump, so the other players must play hearts (other than the five) if they can. If your only heart is the five, you may play it on this trick, but you are not obliged to; you are unable to follow suit with a non-trump heart, so you may play any card. If the cards played to the trick are 7, J, J, 10, the ten wins, since it is the highest heart that was played.\n\n2. Leading a pair of identical cards\nAny pair of identical cards can be led, but note that they do have to be identical, not just equal. For example if nines and spades are trumps, you can lead 9-9, but 9-9 would not be a legal lead.\nWhen an identical pair of trumps is led, each of the other players must play an identical pair of trumps if they have them. Those unable to do this must still play two trumps if possible. A player who holds only one trump must play this with any other card. A player who has no trumps plays any two cards (there is no obligation to play a pair). The trick is won by the highest identical pair of trumps played - unpaired trumps cannot win, even if they are higher.\nWhen an identical pair of non trumps is led, anyone who has a pair of identical cards in the same suit must play such a pair. Those who have no such pair can play any two cards of the suit led. If they only have one card of the suit led, they play that together with any other card. A player who has no cards of the suit led can play any two cards - there is no obligation to play a pair in this case. The trick is won by whoever plays the highest identical pair in the suit led, unless some other player, having no cards of that suit, trumps the trick with a pair of identical trumps. If a pair of identical trumps is played to the trick, the highest pair of identical trumps wins. If two players were to play equally high pairs of trumps - for example 9-9 and 9-9 when nines and spades are trumps - then the first played of these pairs would beat the other. It is not possible to win the trick with two unpaired trumps.\nExamples. Suppose that threes and hearts are trumps.\n\nNorth leads J-J; West has no club pair and plays A-Q; South has only one club and plays 4-10; East, whose clubs are 10, 10, 7, 6, 3, would like to play two worthless low clubs, but must follow with the pair 10-10. North wins the trick, since West\'s unpaired clubs cannot beat a pair.\nNorth leads 5-5, West beats this with K-K, South, having no clubs, trumps with 2-2 and East, who has nothing but trumps, plays 8-7. South wins the trick since East\'s trumps, though higher, are not a pair.\n\n3. Leading a sequence of pairs\nIf the player whose turn it is to lead has two or more consecutive pairs of identical cards in the same suit, they may be led as a group. If fours and diamonds are trumps, the following are examples of sequences of pairs that can be led:\n\n8-8-9-9. Two consectutive pairs are known as a tractor, after which the game is named.\nJ-J-Q-Q-K-K. Three or more consecutive pairs are named after various other vehicles. Unfortunately I do not know what names are used, except that five consecutive pairs are a tank.\n3-3-5-5. When fours are trumps, threes and fives become consecutive.\nA-A-4-4. This is a valid tractor because four in a suit other than diamonds is the next rank above ace.\n4-4-4-4. These ranks are also adjacent when fours and diamonds are trumps.\n4-4-[black joker]-[black joker]\n[black joker]-[black joker]-[red joker]-[red joker]\n\nThe following would not be valid leads:\n\n5-5-7-7. Ranks not adjacent (six missing).\n8-8-9-9. Different suits.\n4-4-5-5. Not adjacent: fours are trumps; fives are not.\n3-3-4-4. Not adjacent: fours are high trumps; next rank above three is five.\n4-4-4-4. Ranks are equal, not adjacent.\n\nWhen a tractor or a longer sequence of adjacent pairs is led, the other players must each play an equal number of cards, following suit in the same way as to a single pair. \nIf the lead is in trumps, the other players must play identical pairs of trumps as far as possible, even if the pairs are not consecutive. If they have no more trump pairs, they must play unmatched trumps. If they have fewer trumps than the number of cards that were led, they must play all their trumps, together with other cards of their choice, to make up the required number of cards. The non-trumps do not have to be in pairs. The trick is won by the highest set of consecutive trump pairs of the same length as the lead - other trumps, paired or not - have no power.\nIf the lead is in a non-trump suit, the other players must follow with the same number of cards, playing identical pairs (not necessarily consecutive) in the suit that was led as far as possible, and then if necessary playing further cards of the led suit to make up a number of cards equal to the number led. Having run out of the suit led, they may other cards of their choice, not necessarily pairs. The trick is won by the highest set of consecutive pairs of the same length as the lead in the suit led, unless some player who has none of the suit led manages to trump with an equally long sequence of consecutive pairs of trumps, in which case the highest such trump sequence wins.\nExample. Kings and clubs are trumps.\n\nWest leads 3-3-4-4. South\'s hearts are J, 10, 10, 8, 6, 5, 5 and South is forced to follow with pairs: 10-10-5-5. East and North do not have heart pairs and follow with unmatched cards. West wins the trick because South\'s pairs, though they are higher, are not consecutive.\n\n4. Leading a set of top cards\nIt is legal to lead any collection of cards of a suit (or of trumps), which can be a mixture of single cards and pairs, provided that there are no cards of that suit remaining in play that could beat any of those single cards or pairs. For example, with fours and clubs as trumps:\n\nA-K-K is a valid lead, since there is only one other heart ace at large so the K-K is unbeatable in hearts.\nIf one ace, one king and both jacks of spades have been played, then A-K-Q-Q-10 is a valid lead (there is no outstanding spade to beat the 10).\nIf one ace and both kings of diamonds have been played then A-Q is a valid lead.\nIf one ace and one king of hearts have been played, A-Q-Q-J is not a valid lead because the jack could be beaten by the outstanding king.\n\nWhen a set of top cards is led, the other players must follow as far as possible with cards of the same suit. If the lead contained pairs, then the other players must include at least that number of pairs in the cards that they follow suit with, if they are able to. If they do not have sufficent cards of the suit led, they make up the required number of cards with any cards of any other suits.\nThe player who led to the trick will win it, unless the lead is in a non-trump suit and some other player, having no cards of the suit led, makes a play consisting entirely of trumps, including as many pairs of identical trumps as there were pairs among the cards led. In that case the trumps win. If more than one player manages to play an appropriate combination of trumps, and the lead included a pair, then whichever of them played the highest trump pair wins (in case of a tie the first played would win as usual). If the lead contained no pairs then the highest single trump played by those who play nothing but trumps wins the trick; in case of a tie for highest trump, the set of trumps played first would win.\nExamples. Sixes and spades are trumps. One ace and one king of clubs have already been played.\n\nNorth leads A-Q-Q, West trumps with A-5-5, South overtrumps with 2-7-7 and East plays three clubs. South wins with the higher trump pair.\nNorth leads A-K-Q, West trumps with 2-7-7, South overtrumps with A-5-5 and East plays three clubs. South wins again because the A beats the 7 - pairs are now irrelevant since no pair was led.\nNorth leads A-K, West trumps with A-3, South has no clubs and A and Q but these two trumps will not beat West\'s, because only the highest trump is compared, and West\'s A was played first.\n\n\nIf a player attempts to lead top cards and it turns out that another player (even the leader\'s partner) can beat any the single cards or pairs with higher cards of the same suit, then the player who led incorrectly must withdraw the lead. The card or pair that can be beaten must be led, and the other player must beat it. Also as a penalty, for each card that has to be withdrawn, 10 card points are transferred from the team that led incorrectly to the other team.\n\nScoring\nThe result depends on the number of card points won by the opponents.\nIf the opponents won the last trick, the eight cards discarded by the starter are exposed. If the starter\'s discard contains any kings, tens or fives, the opponents score twice the value of these cards if the last trick was a single card trick. If the last trick was a multiple trick, then the value of the discards is multiplied by twice the number of cards led to the last trick. For example if the last trick is a tractor trick (four cards) and the opponents win it, they will score eight times the value of any cards in the starter\'s discard. Any points that the opponents score for the starter\'s discard are added to the points that they won in tricks during the play, as represented by the cards that are face up in front of them.\nIf the declarers won the last trick, the opponents just win the point value of the cards that they won in tricks, which are kept face up on the table.\nThe possible results are given in the following table.\n\nOpponents\' card pointsResultNext starter\n0Declarers\' score increased by three ranksStarter\'s partner\n5 - 35Declarers\' score increased by two ranksStarter\'s partner\n40 - 75Declarers\' score increased by one rankStarter\'s partner\n80 - 115Opponents become declarers; no change in scorePlayer to starter\'s right\n120 - 155Opponents become declarers and go up one rankPlayer to starter\'s right\n160 - 195Opponents become declarers and go up two ranksPlayer to starter\'s right\n200 - 235 *Opponents become declarers and go up three ranksPlayer to starter\'s right\n* Although there are only 200 points in the pack, it is possible for the opponents to have more than 200 points by scoring for points in the talon. It is even conceivable, though unlikely, that they might have 240 or more points, in which case they go up a further rank for each increment of 40 points.\n\nExample. North and South are the declarers with a score of 7 and East and West, the opponents have 10. South is the starter. If E-W take 60 points, N-S increase their score to 8 and North is the new starter. If E-W take 85 points, the scores stay at 7 for N-S and 10 for E-W but E-W become the declarers with East as starter. If E-W take 160 points, again E-W become the declarers with East as starter, but E-W\'s score is also increased by two ranks to \'queen\', so that queens will be the trump rank in the next hand.\nAs already mentioned, the winners of the whole game are the first team whose score goes above the rank of ace.\nVariations and related games\n\nGame with three decks\nTractor can be played with three decks including three jokers of each colour. Each player draws 39 cards and the starter takes an additional six cards and discards six. There are then 300 points in the game; the opponents need at least 120 points to win, and each 60 points above or below this is an extra level: for example with 180 to 235 points the opponents become declarers and go up a levels, but if the opponents get 5 to 55 points the declarers go up two levels. \nA single card exposed in the deal to set trumps can be overruled by a pair of identical cards of the trump rank exposed by a different player, and this in turn can be overruled by a triple (which could be created by the first player adding two identical cards to the card first exposed, or could be a completely new triple). As in the two-deck game, you can\'t overrule your own trump directly, but you can overrule your partner. There is no no-trump option (exposing jokers) in this version.\nAs well as single cards and pairs it is possible to lead triples of identical cards; also you can play tractors consisting of sequences of triples or sequences of pairs. When a triple is led, players must follow with triples of that suit if possible; players with no triple must play a pair if possible. When a tractor of any shape is led, players who have a similar shaped tractor in that suit must play it; failing that a shorter tractor. For example if a sequence of three pairs is led, a player with two consecutive pairs in that suit must play it, along with another pair in that suit if held, or failing that any two other cards of the suit.\n\n20 points per rank\nSome play that each 20 points (rather than 40 points) in the play increases the winners\' score by one rank. The opponents still need 80 points to become the declarers, but with 100-115 they also gain a rank, with 120-135 two ranks and so on. When the opponents have 60-75 points the declarers gain a rank, but when the opponents have only 40-55 points the declarers gain two ranks and so on.\n\nCompulsory levels\nIt may be specified that certain scores, such as king and ace, cannot be skipped. So a team whose score should go up by several ranks, according to the card points they have won, cannot go past any of these compulsory levels. For example, if you play that 10 cannot be skipped, your score was 9, and you win in such a way that your score should go up three ranks, you score in fact goes up to 10, not queen, and you play the next hand with tens as trumps.\n\nShort game\nA game can last quite a long time, especially if there are many close deals where the opponents become declarers with no change in score. It can be shortened by playing until a team reaches some lower rank, such as seven, or (perhaps better) by starting at a higher rank, such as seven, instead of at two.\n\nThe hook\nSome play that when jacks are trumps, if a team wins the last trick with the jack of the trump suit, capturing a jack belonging to the other team, then the team whose jack is captured has their score reduced to two. This variation is called "the hook" because of the hook shape of the English letter "J" on the jack.\n\nTractors skip played ranks\nSome allow a tractor to skip ranks of which all the cards have already been played. For example if no one has any 6\'s left then 5-5-7-7 becomes a tractor, and even 5-5-9-9-J-J becomes valid if there are no 6\'s, 7\'s, 8\'s or 10\'s of spades remaining in play.\n\nUsing a joker to change trumps\nIf, during the deal, a player flips a pair of trumps, but another player wishes to change it, he can expose a pair of trumps and a joker. This in turn can be overruled by a pair of trumps and a pair of jokers. Note that overruling always requires a pair of identical trump rank cards - you cannot use a single trump rank card with one or more jokers for this purpose.\n\nSix players\nSix players can play tractor, in two teams of three, sitting alternately. In the deal each player takes 17 cards and there are six extra cards for the starter, who discards six. When the declarers win, the next starter is the partner sitting two places to the right of the current starter. The other rules are identical to the four-player game.\n\nLooking for Friends\nThe related game Zhao Pengyou (Looking for Friends) can be played by five or more. The partnerships are not fixed but are determined by cards called by the trump maker, who also takes the last cards and starts the play. A detailed description can be found on the Zhao Pengyou page.\n\nVariations in the play\nI suspect that there are many slight variations in the rules of play, especially the exact types of leads allowed. The alert reader will notice some differences between the rules of play on this page and on the Zhao Pengyou page. I was taught these games by two different players, and the differences may represent possible variations in both games, rather than a systematic difference between the two games.\n\nSingle deck game - 40 points\nSishi Fen (40 points), also known as Bai Fen (100 points) and by various other names is a four player fixed partnership game, similar to Tractor but played with a single deck. It is probably the game from which Tractor was developed - see the Bai Fen page for a description. \n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > King-Ten-Five group > Tractor\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com). \n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2008.

The practice of varying the number of cards dealt on each hand and of determining the trump suit at random is slightly reminscent of Oh Hell!, but the objective in this game is always to win tricks, not to take the exact number that were bid.\nThe first version of Back Alley described on this page, which seems to be the more prevalent, may have originated in the 1960\'s during the Vietnam war. It is a partnership game, normally played with two jokers, known as bloopers, and the game itself is sometimes called Blooper. It has a fairly strong similarity to Spades, in that the bids of the partners are added together.\nThe second version is played without partners. There are no jokers, and the 2 is usually the highest trump. This version corresponds more closely to the original game played in the 1940\'s.\nPartnership Back Alley\nPlayers\nThere are four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The game is played\nclockwise.\nCards\n54 - a standard 52 card pack with two distinguishable jokers, big and little. The jokers are known as bloopers or blookers. The cards in each non-trump suit rank from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. The big blooper is the highest trump and the little blooper is second highest, so the order of trumps is BB-LB-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2.\nDeal\n13 cards each in the first hand, then one card fewer each successive hand down to one card each. Then a second hand with one card dealt to each player and  rising again to a final deal of 13 each, so that there are 26 deals in a complete game. Turn to deal passes clockwise. So a complete game consists of 25 deals. After the four hands have been dealt the next card is turned up and its suit is trumps for the hand. If the turn up is a joker (blooper) there are no trumps and the holder (if any) of the other joker must discard it and take the next undealt card in exchange.\nBidding\nStarting to dealer\'s left, each player in turn has just one bid. The possible bids are \'pass\', a positive whole number, or \'board\'. There is no requirement for each bid to be higher than the previous one.\n\nIf all pass the cards are thrown in and there is a new deal of the same number of cards by the next dealer. \nIf both members of a team bid a number, those numbers are added and the team\'s aim is to win at least that many tricks. A pass counts as zero. So if the members of a team bid 1 and 4 they try to win at least 5 tricks between them. If they bid pass and 3 they try to win at least 3 tricks. If both pass they have no minimum target, though any tricks they do win will benefit them slightly. The maximum number bid allowed is one less than the number of cards dealt.\nA player who bids \'board\' commits his or her team to try to win all the tricks. If more than one player bids board, the second board bid is a \'double board\', the third is a \'triple board\' and the fourth is a \'quadruple board\'.\n\n\n\nPlay\nThe highest bidder leads to the first trick. If more than one player bid the same number the earliest of those bidders leads. If more than one player bid a board the last of them leads.\nPlayers must follow suit. If unable to follow suit you may play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if it contains no trumps, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nIt is illegal to lead a trump unless either \n\ntrumps have been \'broken\' - i.e. someone has already played a trump to a previous trick, or\nyou have bid a board (or a double, triple or quadruple board).\n\nIf the big blooper is led to a trick, each of the other players must play their highest trump. If the little blooper is led the other players must play their lowest trump (note that the little blooper might still be beaten if someone\'s only remaining trump was the big blooper). These constraints do not apply when a blooper is played other than as the first card of a trick. Also, a player who has no trumps is free to discard any card when a blooper is led.\nScoring\nA team which wins at least as many tricks as they bid scores 5 points per trick bid, plus 1 point for each trick won in excess of the bid. If they win fewer tricks than they bid, they lose 5 points for each trick bid.\nA team which bid board scores 10 points per trick if they succeed in winning all the tricks; if they fail they lose the same amount (e.g. 50 points in a five card hand). A team which bid double, triple or quadruple board wins 2, 3 or 4 times as much. (When a team bids board only their highest bid counts; the other partner\'s bid does not affect the score). \nVariations\n\nBoards\nSome play that after any player has bid board, the player\'s partner may increase the team\'s bid to a double board, which scores 15 points per trick. So if you started with a number and your partner bid board, you could increase it to double board. In this version it is possible for both teams to bid board or double board independently of each other; there is no triple or quadruple board bid. In determining the first lead, I think that double board takes precedence over board, and between two equal bids, the player whose first turn to bid was earlier has precedence.\nBoston\nThis is a bid, in a hand with more than 6 cards dealt, undertaking that the bidding team will win the first 6 tricks. It is worth 100 points for the first 6 tricks plus 1 for each additional trick. If the bidding team loses any of the first 6 tricks, they lose 100 points.\nRainbow\nIn this popular variation, when exactly four cards are dealt, a hand consisting of one card of each suit is called a rainbow. This can be announced at the player\'s turn to bid for an extra bonus of 40 points provided that the player wins at least one trick. The rainbow player leads to the first trick. In the event that more than one player bids rainbow, the first rainbow bidder leads to the first trick.\nSome also allow rainbow to be announced with 2 cards of each suit in the 8-card deal for 80 points and with 3 cards of each suit in the 12-card deal for 120 points. To score these points the rainbow player has to win at least 2 tricks with an 8-card rainbow and at least 3 with a 12-card rainbow.\nIf the rainbow player fails to take the required tricks (at least 1 trick with four cards, 2 tricks with 8 cards, 3 tricks with 12 cards), the rainbow points are subtracted from the team\'s score instead of added. Partner\'s tricks do not help here - if you announce a rainbow you have to take the required tricks yourself or lose the points. Of course, a player with a rainbow hand is not obliged to announce the rainbow, and should not do so unless there is a good chance of winning the required tricks.\nThe rainbow announcement also counts as a normal bid of the relevant number of tricks, and the player can increase it by announcing "rainbow+1", "rainbow+2", etc. This is then added to partner\'s bid as usual. Example: with 8 cards dealt North bids "rainbow+1" (meaning 3 tricks) and South bids 1. This commits the team to win at least 4 tricks. If North wins 2 and South wins 3 they will score +101 points: 80 for the rainbow, 20 for the bid and one for the overtrick. If North wins 2 tricks and South 1 they score +60, winning 80 for the rainbow but losing 20 for the failed bid. If North wins 1 trick and South wins 3 they score -60, losing 80 for the rainbow but winning 20 for the bid.\nSome play the rainbow announcement without the trick-taking requirement. Announcing a rainbow with 4 cards at your turn to bid simply gives your team a bonus of 40 points as compensation for telling everyone that you have a card of every suit. The rainbow player also makes a normal bid or pass which is added to partner\'s bid in the usual way.\nUsually a player who has announced a rainbow is required to keep their cards on the table in front of them as they are played, rather than have them gathered up with the tricks, so that everyone can verify that the rainbow player really has the claimed distribution of suits.\nBlind bids\nSome play that at the halfway point up and down (the 7-card deals with 4 players), the hands are bid "blind" (i.e. without looking at the cards). In this version, if a joker is turned as trump it is "burned" (put at the bottom of the deck) and trump is determined by the next card turned. In the case where both jokers are "burned" and there are no more cards available (i.e. at the 13-card deal with 4 players), there is no trump. The score is the number of tricks bid plus the number of tricks won if the bid is successful. If the tricks won are less than tricks bid, the team loses 2 points per trick bid regardless of how many were won. There are no "board" bids.\n\n\nNumber of players and individual play\n3 players can play as individuals, starting at 13 cards each and working down to 1 card and back to 13 as usual. 4 can play as individuals rather than in partnerships. 5 can play as individuals, starting and ending at 10 cards each. I have been told that 6 could play - presumably they form 2 teams of three or 3 teams of two.\nBig blooper\nSome play that when your partner leads the big blooper, you do not have to waste your highest trump: you are allowed to follow with a low trump. Some say that you must play your lowest trump - which is usually what you would wish to do anyway.\nCards dealt\nI have been told that some do not vary the deal, but deal the same number of cards each time - presumably 13.\nSome play 25 deals rather than 26, with just one one-card deal in the middle.\n\nGame with high two of spades\nThis 26-deal game is played with a 52-card deck without jokers. The game begins with a 1-card deal, then increases one at a time to the maximum 13 cards and decreases again to 1 card. There are two 13-card deals in the middle, and in these the deck is cut before dealing to determine trumps. The two of spades is normally the highest trump, above the ace, and counts as belonging to the trump suit. The exception is when the two of spades is cut or turned for trump, in which case there are no trumps. \nTrumps cannot be led except in two cases: (a) when the leader is "tight" (holds nothing but trumps) and (b) the leader holds two of spades and chooses to lead it. When the two of spades is led the other players must play their highest trumps to this trick. The player who led the spade two can then continue to lead trumps (but the other players do not have to play high) until he loses a trick. Once the player who led the spade two loses a trick or leads anything other than trump, it is again illegal to lead trumps unless the player on lead is tight.\nPlayers sitting opposite are partners, but the scoring is based on the tricks won by individual players compared to their bids, and the partners\' scores are then combined. The score is 10 points per trick bid and made plus one for each overtrick. If the bid fails the loss is 10 points per trick bid. Example: if North bids 4, South bids 2 and they win 3 tricks each, then North scores -40 and South +21 for a total of -19 for the partnership.\nBoard can be bid only on the 1-card deals: after a player has bid 1, another player can bid "board" for 20, a third player "double board" for 30 and the last player "triple board" for 40.\nOn a deal of 7 or more cards,  if any player has no trumps the hands are thrown in and redealt, unless it was a no-trump deal (two of spades cut or turned for trump).\n\nReduced Deck\nI have seen one report of a version played with a reduced deck of 42 cards, with 4\'s, 3\'s and 2\'s removed. In the first hand 10 cards each are dealt and this is reduced by one for each subsequent hand as usual.\n\nAll: game without jokers\nOne correspondent reports a variation known as "All", played without jokers (in the 13-card deals the cards are cut for trump before dealing). Instead of the "board" bid, there is a bid of "all", allowed only when 5 or fewer cards each are dealt. This is a commitment that the player\'s team will win every trick and scores 25 points if successful or loses 25 points if not.\n\nSpades trump\nSome play with Spades as permanent trumps, instead of turning up a card for trumps on each deal.\n\nRedeal\nSome play that when a hand of 6 or more cards are dealt, a player who has no aces, no face cards and no trumps is allowed to demand a new deal by the same dealer.\n\nIndividual Back Alley\nThis version of the game dates from World War II. It is played with a 52 card pack without jokers. The two of diamonds is highest trump, followed by the Ace of the trump suit, so the trumps rank 2-A-K-Q-J-10-9- etc.\nThe game is played by two, three or four players, without partners. If there are fewer than four players there will be undealt cards, even in the 13-card hand.\nThere are 14 deals in a game. In the first deal, 13 cards are dealt to each player. In each subsequent deal, the number of cards dealt is reduced by one, and the last two deals are of one card each.\nBefore the 13-card deal with 4 players, the cards are cut to determine the trump suit; in all other deals, the first undealt card is turned up to determine the trump suit. If the 2 is cut or turned up, diamonds are trumps.\nEach player in turn bids a number of tricks. A bid of no tricks is a pass, and if all players pass, the hand is redealt by the same dealer.\nThe highest bidder leads to the first trick; if there were several equally high bids the first of these bidders leads. Any card can be led - there are no restrictions on leading trumps. It is compulsory to follow suit whenever you can; note that (unless diamonds are trumps) the 2 is not a diamond but is treated as belonging to the trump suit. A player unable to follow suit to a non-trump lead must trump. If a non-trump lead has already been trumped, a subsequent player who is unable to follow suit must beat the highest trump in the trick if possible - if unable to do this he may play any card. A player who is unable to follow suit may play any card.\nFor the hands with more than one card dealt, if you make at least as many tricks as you bid, you score 3 points for each you bid, plus one extra point for each trick you make in excess of your bid. If you fail to make as many tricks as you bid, you lose 3 points for each trick that you bid, irrespective of how many you made.\nIf you bid for all the available tricks, this is called board, and you win 6 points per trick bid if successful and lose 6 points per trick bid otherwise. There are no double board bids, but it is possible for more than one player to bid board.\nOn the one card deals, you only options are to bid board - for which you win 13 points if you win the trick and lose 13 points if you don\'t - or to pass - in which case you score no points regardless of whether or not you win the trick.\nVariations of Individual Back Alley\n\n18 deal game\nSome start at a deal of 9 cards each, work down to 1 (twice) and back up to 9 for a total of 18 deals. A player who has one cards of each suit in a 4-card deal can declare this during the bidding for a 5-point bonus. Declaring two cards of each suit in the 8-card deal gives a 10-point bonus. A board bid is worth an extra 10 points if successful, but loses an extra 10 points if it fails. The correspondent who reported this version calls it "Oh Hell", a name which is normally used for a different game in which the aim is to take the exact number of tricks that are bid.\n\nTwos of diamonds and trumps high\nSome play that if diamonds are not trumps, the second highest trump is the two of the trump suit, and the trump ace is third highest.\n\n26 deal version\nThis may have originated in the Korean War. There is no high two - the ace of trumps is highest. After the two one-card deals, further hands are played with the number of cards dealt to each player increasing by one each time, up to the maximum 13. Trumps cannot be led until they have been broken. Players score 5 points each for tricks bid and made, plus 1 point for each overtrick. A player who makes fewer tricks than they bid loses 5 points per undertrick. A player can bid "bort" (presumably a corruption of "board"), an undertaking to win every trick, scoring 10 points per trick if successful, but otherwise losing the full amount of the bid. In the four-card deal a player with a "rainbow" (one card of each suit) can declare it during the bidding for a 40 point bonus. The cards are not shown at this stage: the other players should check that the player really has the claimed rainbow. A false rainbow announcement loses 40 points.\nThis game is intermediate between the two main versions described on this page. It is an individual game, but the deal sequence, the play (no trump leads until broken), the scoring and the rainbow bid are more typical of the newer partnership game.\n\nOther Back Alley WWW Pages\nThis archive copy of Sgt Grit\'s Back Alley Bridge Rules gives another description of the game with bloopers.\nA commercial version of Back Alley was advertised at http://www.backalleygames.com but the web site has since disappeared. I have not seen the actual product, but there were some rules on the web page. The game is related to WWII game described above, and there are no partnerships. It is played with a special pack of 56 cards: four suits of 13 plus four identical wild cards. No card is turned for trumps - the only trumps are the four wild cards. If you can\'t follow suit you must trump with a wild card if you have one, and when a wild card is played subsequent players are released from the obligation to follow suit in that trick and may play any card. If several wilds are played to a trick the first wins. It\'s illegal to lead a wild card unless you have nothing else in your hand. Before play each player can discard one card and draw one of the undealt cards. Score is 3 points per trick bid plus 1 per overtrick if successful; lose 3 per trick bid if unsuccessful.\nContributors\nMost of the information on this page is based on  e-mails and news postings from Charles Petro, Howard L Wagner, Rand  Collins, Daniel Grimes, Cindy Ingels, Douglas Nitch, David Brandt, Amber  Sexton, Becky B, Tim Arview and Vincent Higginbotham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Boston group > Back Alley\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2003, 2007.

The practice of varying the number of cards dealt on each hand and of determining the trump suit at random is slightly reminscent of Oh Hell!, but the objective in this game is always to win tricks, not to take the exact number that were bid.\nThe first version of Back Alley described on this page, which seems to be the more prevalent, may have originated in the 1960\'s during the Vietnam war. It is a partnership game, normally played with two jokers, known as bloopers, and the game itself is sometimes called Blooper. It has a fairly strong similarity to Spades, in that the bids of the partners are added together.\nThe second version is played without partners. There are no jokers, and the 2 is usually the highest trump. This version corresponds more closely to the original game played in the 1940\'s.\nPartnership Back Alley\nPlayers\nThere are four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The game is played\nclockwise.\nCards\n54 - a standard 52 card pack with two distinguishable jokers, big and little. The jokers are known as bloopers or blookers. The cards in each non-trump suit rank from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. The big blooper is the highest trump and the little blooper is second highest, so the order of trumps is BB-LB-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2.\nDeal\n13 cards each in the first hand, then one card fewer each successive hand down to one card each. Then a second hand with one card dealt to each player and  rising again to a final deal of 13 each, so that there are 26 deals in a complete game. Turn to deal passes clockwise. So a complete game consists of 25 deals. After the four hands have been dealt the next card is turned up and its suit is trumps for the hand. If the turn up is a joker (blooper) there are no trumps and the holder (if any) of the other joker must discard it and take the next undealt card in exchange.\nBidding\nStarting to dealer\'s left, each player in turn has just one bid. The possible bids are \'pass\', a positive whole number, or \'board\'. There is no requirement for each bid to be higher than the previous one.\n\nIf all pass the cards are thrown in and there is a new deal of the same number of cards by the next dealer. \nIf both members of a team bid a number, those numbers are added and the team\'s aim is to win at least that many tricks. A pass counts as zero. So if the members of a team bid 1 and 4 they try to win at least 5 tricks between them. If they bid pass and 3 they try to win at least 3 tricks. If both pass they have no minimum target, though any tricks they do win will benefit them slightly. The maximum number bid allowed is one less than the number of cards dealt.\nA player who bids \'board\' commits his or her team to try to win all the tricks. If more than one player bids board, the second board bid is a \'double board\', the third is a \'triple board\' and the fourth is a \'quadruple board\'.\n\n\n\nPlay\nThe highest bidder leads to the first trick. If more than one player bid the same number the earliest of those bidders leads. If more than one player bid a board the last of them leads.\nPlayers must follow suit. If unable to follow suit you may play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if it contains no trumps, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nIt is illegal to lead a trump unless either \n\ntrumps have been \'broken\' - i.e. someone has already played a trump to a previous trick, or\nyou have bid a board (or a double, triple or quadruple board).\n\nIf the big blooper is led to a trick, each of the other players must play their highest trump. If the little blooper is led the other players must play their lowest trump (note that the little blooper might still be beaten if someone\'s only remaining trump was the big blooper). These constraints do not apply when a blooper is played other than as the first card of a trick. Also, a player who has no trumps is free to discard any card when a blooper is led.\nScoring\nA team which wins at least as many tricks as they bid scores 5 points per trick bid, plus 1 point for each trick won in excess of the bid. If they win fewer tricks than they bid, they lose 5 points for each trick bid.\nA team which bid board scores 10 points per trick if they succeed in winning all the tricks; if they fail they lose the same amount (e.g. 50 points in a five card hand). A team which bid double, triple or quadruple board wins 2, 3 or 4 times as much. (When a team bids board only their highest bid counts; the other partner\'s bid does not affect the score). \nVariations\n\nBoards\nSome play that after any player has bid board, the player\'s partner may increase the team\'s bid to a double board, which scores 15 points per trick. So if you started with a number and your partner bid board, you could increase it to double board. In this version it is possible for both teams to bid board or double board independently of each other; there is no triple or quadruple board bid. In determining the first lead, I think that double board takes precedence over board, and between two equal bids, the player whose first turn to bid was earlier has precedence.\nBoston\nThis is a bid, in a hand with more than 6 cards dealt, undertaking that the bidding team will win the first 6 tricks. It is worth 100 points for the first 6 tricks plus 1 for each additional trick. If the bidding team loses any of the first 6 tricks, they lose 100 points.\nRainbow\nIn this popular variation, when exactly four cards are dealt, a hand consisting of one card of each suit is called a rainbow. This can be announced at the player\'s turn to bid for an extra bonus of 40 points provided that the player wins at least one trick. The rainbow player leads to the first trick. In the event that more than one player bids rainbow, the first rainbow bidder leads to the first trick.\nSome also allow rainbow to be announced with 2 cards of each suit in the 8-card deal for 80 points and with 3 cards of each suit in the 12-card deal for 120 points. To score these points the rainbow player has to win at least 2 tricks with an 8-card rainbow and at least 3 with a 12-card rainbow.\nIf the rainbow player fails to take the required tricks (at least 1 trick with four cards, 2 tricks with 8 cards, 3 tricks with 12 cards), the rainbow points are subtracted from the team\'s score instead of added. Partner\'s tricks do not help here - if you announce a rainbow you have to take the required tricks yourself or lose the points. Of course, a player with a rainbow hand is not obliged to announce the rainbow, and should not do so unless there is a good chance of winning the required tricks.\nThe rainbow announcement also counts as a normal bid of the relevant number of tricks, and the player can increase it by announcing "rainbow+1", "rainbow+2", etc. This is then added to partner\'s bid as usual. Example: with 8 cards dealt North bids "rainbow+1" (meaning 3 tricks) and South bids 1. This commits the team to win at least 4 tricks. If North wins 2 and South wins 3 they will score +101 points: 80 for the rainbow, 20 for the bid and one for the overtrick. If North wins 2 tricks and South 1 they score +60, winning 80 for the rainbow but losing 20 for the failed bid. If North wins 1 trick and South wins 3 they score -60, losing 80 for the rainbow but winning 20 for the bid.\nSome play the rainbow announcement without the trick-taking requirement. Announcing a rainbow with 4 cards at your turn to bid simply gives your team a bonus of 40 points as compensation for telling everyone that you have a card of every suit. The rainbow player also makes a normal bid or pass which is added to partner\'s bid in the usual way.\nUsually a player who has announced a rainbow is required to keep their cards on the table in front of them as they are played, rather than have them gathered up with the tricks, so that everyone can verify that the rainbow player really has the claimed distribution of suits.\nBlind bids\nSome play that at the halfway point up and down (the 7-card deals with 4 players), the hands are bid "blind" (i.e. without looking at the cards). In this version, if a joker is turned as trump it is "burned" (put at the bottom of the deck) and trump is determined by the next card turned. In the case where both jokers are "burned" and there are no more cards available (i.e. at the 13-card deal with 4 players), there is no trump. The score is the number of tricks bid plus the number of tricks won if the bid is successful. If the tricks won are less than tricks bid, the team loses 2 points per trick bid regardless of how many were won. There are no "board" bids.\n\n\nNumber of players and individual play\n3 players can play as individuals, starting at 13 cards each and working down to 1 card and back to 13 as usual. 4 can play as individuals rather than in partnerships. 5 can play as individuals, starting and ending at 10 cards each. I have been told that 6 could play - presumably they form 2 teams of three or 3 teams of two.\nBig blooper\nSome play that when your partner leads the big blooper, you do not have to waste your highest trump: you are allowed to follow with a low trump. Some say that you must play your lowest trump - which is usually what you would wish to do anyway.\nCards dealt\nI have been told that some do not vary the deal, but deal the same number of cards each time - presumably 13.\nSome play 25 deals rather than 26, with just one one-card deal in the middle.\n\nGame with high two of spades\nThis 26-deal game is played with a 52-card deck without jokers. The game begins with a 1-card deal, then increases one at a time to the maximum 13 cards and decreases again to 1 card. There are two 13-card deals in the middle, and in these the deck is cut before dealing to determine trumps. The two of spades is normally the highest trump, above the ace, and counts as belonging to the trump suit. The exception is when the two of spades is cut or turned for trump, in which case there are no trumps. \nTrumps cannot be led except in two cases: (a) when the leader is "tight" (holds nothing but trumps) and (b) the leader holds two of spades and chooses to lead it. When the two of spades is led the other players must play their highest trumps to this trick. The player who led the spade two can then continue to lead trumps (but the other players do not have to play high) until he loses a trick. Once the player who led the spade two loses a trick or leads anything other than trump, it is again illegal to lead trumps unless the player on lead is tight.\nPlayers sitting opposite are partners, but the scoring is based on the tricks won by individual players compared to their bids, and the partners\' scores are then combined. The score is 10 points per trick bid and made plus one for each overtrick. If the bid fails the loss is 10 points per trick bid. Example: if North bids 4, South bids 2 and they win 3 tricks each, then North scores -40 and South +21 for a total of -19 for the partnership.\nBoard can be bid only on the 1-card deals: after a player has bid 1, another player can bid "board" for 20, a third player "double board" for 30 and the last player "triple board" for 40.\nOn a deal of 7 or more cards,  if any player has no trumps the hands are thrown in and redealt, unless it was a no-trump deal (two of spades cut or turned for trump).\n\nReduced Deck\nI have seen one report of a version played with a reduced deck of 42 cards, with 4\'s, 3\'s and 2\'s removed. In the first hand 10 cards each are dealt and this is reduced by one for each subsequent hand as usual.\n\nAll: game without jokers\nOne correspondent reports a variation known as "All", played without jokers (in the 13-card deals the cards are cut for trump before dealing). Instead of the "board" bid, there is a bid of "all", allowed only when 5 or fewer cards each are dealt. This is a commitment that the player\'s team will win every trick and scores 25 points if successful or loses 25 points if not.\n\nSpades trump\nSome play with Spades as permanent trumps, instead of turning up a card for trumps on each deal.\n\nRedeal\nSome play that when a hand of 6 or more cards are dealt, a player who has no aces, no face cards and no trumps is allowed to demand a new deal by the same dealer.\n\nIndividual Back Alley\nThis version of the game dates from World War II. It is played with a 52 card pack without jokers. The two of diamonds is highest trump, followed by the Ace of the trump suit, so the trumps rank 2-A-K-Q-J-10-9- etc.\nThe game is played by two, three or four players, without partners. If there are fewer than four players there will be undealt cards, even in the 13-card hand.\nThere are 14 deals in a game. In the first deal, 13 cards are dealt to each player. In each subsequent deal, the number of cards dealt is reduced by one, and the last two deals are of one card each.\nBefore the 13-card deal with 4 players, the cards are cut to determine the trump suit; in all other deals, the first undealt card is turned up to determine the trump suit. If the 2 is cut or turned up, diamonds are trumps.\nEach player in turn bids a number of tricks. A bid of no tricks is a pass, and if all players pass, the hand is redealt by the same dealer.\nThe highest bidder leads to the first trick; if there were several equally high bids the first of these bidders leads. Any card can be led - there are no restrictions on leading trumps. It is compulsory to follow suit whenever you can; note that (unless diamonds are trumps) the 2 is not a diamond but is treated as belonging to the trump suit. A player unable to follow suit to a non-trump lead must trump. If a non-trump lead has already been trumped, a subsequent player who is unable to follow suit must beat the highest trump in the trick if possible - if unable to do this he may play any card. A player who is unable to follow suit may play any card.\nFor the hands with more than one card dealt, if you make at least as many tricks as you bid, you score 3 points for each you bid, plus one extra point for each trick you make in excess of your bid. If you fail to make as many tricks as you bid, you lose 3 points for each trick that you bid, irrespective of how many you made.\nIf you bid for all the available tricks, this is called board, and you win 6 points per trick bid if successful and lose 6 points per trick bid otherwise. There are no double board bids, but it is possible for more than one player to bid board.\nOn the one card deals, you only options are to bid board - for which you win 13 points if you win the trick and lose 13 points if you don\'t - or to pass - in which case you score no points regardless of whether or not you win the trick.\nVariations of Individual Back Alley\n\n18 deal game\nSome start at a deal of 9 cards each, work down to 1 (twice) and back up to 9 for a total of 18 deals. A player who has one cards of each suit in a 4-card deal can declare this during the bidding for a 5-point bonus. Declaring two cards of each suit in the 8-card deal gives a 10-point bonus. A board bid is worth an extra 10 points if successful, but loses an extra 10 points if it fails. The correspondent who reported this version calls it "Oh Hell", a name which is normally used for a different game in which the aim is to take the exact number of tricks that are bid.\n\nTwos of diamonds and trumps high\nSome play that if diamonds are not trumps, the second highest trump is the two of the trump suit, and the trump ace is third highest.\n\n26 deal version\nThis may have originated in the Korean War. There is no high two - the ace of trumps is highest. After the two one-card deals, further hands are played with the number of cards dealt to each player increasing by one each time, up to the maximum 13. Trumps cannot be led until they have been broken. Players score 5 points each for tricks bid and made, plus 1 point for each overtrick. A player who makes fewer tricks than they bid loses 5 points per undertrick. A player can bid "bort" (presumably a corruption of "board"), an undertaking to win every trick, scoring 10 points per trick if successful, but otherwise losing the full amount of the bid. In the four-card deal a player with a "rainbow" (one card of each suit) can declare it during the bidding for a 40 point bonus. The cards are not shown at this stage: the other players should check that the player really has the claimed rainbow. A false rainbow announcement loses 40 points.\nThis game is intermediate between the two main versions described on this page. It is an individual game, but the deal sequence, the play (no trump leads until broken), the scoring and the rainbow bid are more typical of the newer partnership game.\n\nOther Back Alley WWW Pages\nThis archive copy of Sgt Grit\'s Back Alley Bridge Rules gives another description of the game with bloopers.\nA commercial version of Back Alley was advertised at http://www.backalleygames.com but the web site has since disappeared. I have not seen the actual product, but there were some rules on the web page. The game is related to WWII game described above, and there are no partnerships. It is played with a special pack of 56 cards: four suits of 13 plus four identical wild cards. No card is turned for trumps - the only trumps are the four wild cards. If you can\'t follow suit you must trump with a wild card if you have one, and when a wild card is played subsequent players are released from the obligation to follow suit in that trick and may play any card. If several wilds are played to a trick the first wins. It\'s illegal to lead a wild card unless you have nothing else in your hand. Before play each player can discard one card and draw one of the undealt cards. Score is 3 points per trick bid plus 1 per overtrick if successful; lose 3 per trick bid if unsuccessful.\nContributors\nMost of the information on this page is based on  e-mails and news postings from Charles Petro, Howard L Wagner, Rand  Collins, Daniel Grimes, Cindy Ingels, Douglas Nitch, David Brandt, Amber  Sexton, Becky B, Tim Arview and Vincent Higginbotham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Boston group > Back Alley\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2003, 2007.

Whoever collects most sets wins. The basic idea is very simple and they are often thought of as children\'s games.\nSo far as I know, games of this type first appeared in the mid 19th century and were played with special cards. In Britain there was  Spade the Gardener, in which players collect families of five cards, later superseded by Happy Families, in which each family consists of four cards (mother, father, son, daughter).  In the USA, the game of Dr Busby, also based on families, was first published in 1843, followed by Authors in 1861. I do not know whether these games were based on an earlier game played with standard cards, or whether the adaptation to use a standard pack came later.\nGo Fish\n\nThis game is often just known as Fish, but the name "Fish" (or Canadian Fish or Russian Fish) is also sometimes used for the more complex partnership game Literature. Go Fish is best for 3-6 players, but it is possible for 2 to play. A standard 52 card deck is used. The dealer deals 5 cards to each player (7 each for 2 players). The remaining cards are placed face down to form a stock.\n\nThe player to dealer\'s left starts. A turn consists of asking a specific player for a specific rank. For example, if it is my turn I might say: \'Mary, please give me your jacks\'. The player who asks must already hold at least one card of the requested rank, so I must hold at least one jack to say this. If the player who was asked (Mary) has cards  of the named rank (jacks in this case), she must give all her cards of this rank to the player who asked for them. That player then gets another turn and may again ask any player for any rank already held by the asker.\n\nIf the person asked does not have any cards of the named rank, they say \'Go fish!\'. The asker must then draw the top card of the undealt stock. If the drawn card is the rank  asked for, the asker shows it and gets another turn. If the drawn card is not the rank asked for, the asker keeps it, but the turn now passes to the player who said \'Go fish!\'.\n\nAs soon as a player collects a book of 4 cards of the same rank, this must be shown and discarded face down. The game continues until either someone has no cards left in their hand or the stock runs out. The winner is the player who then has the most books.\n\n\nVariations of Go Fish\n\nSome people play that rather than asking for a rank, you must ask for a specific card. You must already hold at least one card of that rank. For example, you say: \'Tom, please give me the seven of diamonds\'. If Tom has it he gives it and you get another turn. If he doesn\'t, he says \'Go Fish!\' and you draw from the stock. In the unlikely event that you draw the seven of diamonds you get another turn; if you draw anything else it is now Tom\'s turn.\n\nIf you play this variation, you need to agree whether it is permissible to ask for a card which you already hold in your hand. Obviously you\'ll have to fish and your turn will end, but you might do this deliberately to mislead the other players into thinking that you didn\'t hold that card.\n\nSome people play that when the stock runs out, you carry on playing until all the cards have been made into books. Obviously after the stock has run out there is no \'Go Fish!\'. If the person you asked doesn\'t have the card asked for, the turn passes directly to them.\n\nSome people play that when a player runs out of cards, the play does not end, but the player draws a new hand of 5 cards from the stock (or the whole stock if fewer than 5 cards remain there).\n\nSome people play that after a player fishes unsuccessfully, the turn passes to the left, rather than to the player who said "go fish".\n\nThere are various ways of scoring. For example, you may play a series of hands, scoring one point for each book you make. The game continues until someone wins by reaching an agreed target score - for example, 10 points.\n\n\nA few people  score according to the cards in the books, for example 2-10 face value, 11 for jacks, 12 for queens, 13 for kings, 15 for aces.\nAustralian Fish\nPaul Gardner-Stephen reports that in Australia a variant is often played in which the object is to collect pairs. 7 cards are dealt to each player from a 52-card pack. The player with most pairs plays first. At your turn you ask for a card matching one you have in your hand. All pairs must be put down as soon as they are obtained - you cannot hoard a pair in hand as a basis for asking for the other two matching cards. A player who runs out of cards draws a new hand of 7 cards from the undealt stock. Play continues until everyone has run out of cards, and players score a point for each pair they have made. \nThis game is sometimes played with special cards, and sometimes with a 54-card pack including two jokers, which act as normal cards forming a pair.  Jonny Groves describes a similar game played in the USA, and suggests that a pair of jokers should be scored as 2 points rather than 1 since it is harder to make than other pairs. For similar reasons, collecting two pairs of the same rank should score 3 points rather than 2.\nA variant Backstab Fish is played in Adelaide with 108 cards including four jokers. There are 4-10 players, 7 cards each are dealt and the aim is to make sets of four equal cards, suits being ignored. At your turn you ask a specific player for a specific number of cards of a rank of which you hold at least one: for example you could ask a player for three sixes if you hold a six. The player gives you the exact number of cards you asked for, if she has them: if not - for example if she only has two sixes - you have to draw a card from the stock and the turn passes to the player you asked. In this game you are not required to lay down four of a kind. You can keep them as a basis for asking for more cards of that rank, but if you do not put them down you may lose some or all of them if another player asks for them.\nOmben / Minuman\nThe Indonesian version of Go Fish is known as Omben in Javanese or Minuman in Indonesian, both names meaning "drink". It is said to be best for two players, each of whom begins with a hand of 4 or 5 cards (according to agreement) drawn from a 52 card pack. The players take turns to ask their opponent for a  rank, such as 8 or king, and the opponent must give the asker all cards of that rank that he or she holds. If the opponent has no such card the asker must "drink" by  drawing cards from the pile of undealt cards: the asker continues to  draw until he or she finds a card of the rank that was asked for. Whenever a player has  four of a kind in hand, it must be discarded face up. The winner is the first player to get rid of all their cards - it does not matter how many or few sets they have made. If the stock runs out, the player with fewer cards is the winner. Note that in this game the players ask alternately, irrespective of whether the card asked for is found in the other player\'s hand or the draw pile.\nAuthors\n\nThis is Go Fish without the stock pile. All the cards are dealt out as equally as possible to the players. A turn consists of asking a player for a rank (or a specific card if you play that version). If they have it your turn continues; if not the turn passes to the player you asked. As in Go Fish, you must have a card of the rank you asked for. Books of 4 cards are discarded. The game continues until all the cards are formed into books, and whoever gets most books wins - or you can score one point per book and play to a target score.\n\n\nThis game is called Authors in the USA, because it was originally played with special educational cards showing pictures of famous authors. These cards are still available and the idea has been extended to cards showing inventors, American presidents, explorers, baseball players and many other themes. A selection of different types of Authors cards is available from from funagain.com\n\n\n\n\nVIEW THE WHOLE RANGE\nHappy Families\nThis British version of the game is played with a special pack of 44 cards depicting the mother, father, son and daughter of eleven families. Everyone contributes equally to a pool, all the cards are dealt, and the player to dealer\'s left begins. The player whose turn it is asks another player for a specific card; the asker must already hold at least one card of the same family. If the player asked has the card it must be handed over and the asker continues by asking the same or another player for another card. If the asked player does not have the wanted card they say "not at home" and the turn passes to them. Completed families are placed face down in front of the owner. When all families are complete, the player with most wins half the pool.\nThe game then continues into a second phase, in which players ask for complete families. The winner of the first phase begins, and the player who manages to accumulate all eleven families wins the second half of the pool.\nSome play a version in which a player asking for a card must say "please", and a player receiving a card must say "thank you". Anyone who forgets to do this must give back the requested card (if it has been handed over) and the turn passes to the player they were asking.\nIn the French Jeu des Sept Familles each family has six members including two grandparents, so that the seven families make up a 42-card pack.\nPi Hng ()\nThis Thai game, whose name means "room card", is essentially the same as Happy Families. It is played by 3 to 6 players using a standard 52-card pack. All the cards are dealt out as evenly as possible, and the aim is to collect fours of a kind. The player next to the dealer who received the first card in the deal begins. At your turn you ask another player for a specific card by rank and suit (e.g. 6 of diamonds): in order to ask for a card you must have a card of that rank in your hand. If the player you asked has the requested card you receive it and your turn continues. If not, the turn passes to the player you asked. A set of four equal cards is called a room (hng): a player who collects one of these can store the cards face down or keep them in hand. The game ends when all 13 rooms have been collected, and the player with most rooms wins.\nQuartett\nThis is the German equivalent of Happy Families or Authors. Quartett can be played with a standard 32-card pack (A-K-D-B-10-9-8-7), as used for the German national game Skat. However, this is not longer usual as a huge variety of special Quartett packs are available. These mostly also consist of eight quartets and therefore 32 cards.Many different designs of cards have been made for this game from the late nineteenth to the present day, with various educational or other themes. German Quartett cards are often provided with technical statistics related to the theme of the pack, so that they can also be used to play Top Trumps, which in German is sometimes known as Supertrumpf, and sometimes include a Schwarzer Peter (Black Peter) card so that they can be used for the German equivalent of Old Maid.\n Three or More Players\nThe cards are thoruoghly shuffled and dealt out to the players one at a time clockwise. Some players will have one more card than others, but this does not matter. The player to dealer\'s left begins by asking any other player for a specific card: "Heini, do you have the king of hearts?".\nThe player asking for a card must already hold at least one card of the same quartet. If the player who is hasked has the requested card, it must be given to the player who asked, who can then ask the same or another player for another card. If the player who is asked does not have the requested card, then the turn passes to that player, who now asks any player for a card. Whenever a player collects a complete quartet (four cards of the same rank when using standard cards), these are placed face up on the table. If this leaves the player without cards, the turn to ask passes to the next player to the left.\nThe winner is the player who has most quartets when all the cards have been laid down.\nTwo Players\nEach player is dealt a hand of 10 cards and the remaining 12 cards are stacked face down on the table. A  player who does not have the requested card draws one card from the stock before asking the opponent for a card. The remaining rules are the same as in the three-player game.\n Quartett Cards\n Many Quartett packs with various themes have been published. The variety is so great as to give ther impression that  they are seen more as picture books or as collectible objects than as cards for a game. Leonhard Stork\'s catalogue Spielzeit  Bestimmungshandbuch fr Quartett- und  Peterspiele von 1880 bis heute (Playtime - identification handbook for Quartett and Black Peter cards from 1880 to the present), published in August 2000 and now out of print, lists 4800 different German Quartett and Black Peter packs. The interested collector can however obtain several illustrated catalogues by the same author covering particular themes - these can be ordered from amazon.com. Modern Quartett decks sometimes have quite strange themes, such as suicide (Selbstmordquartett) and worse - see www.quartett.net.\nGerman Quartett cards are often provided with technical statistics  related to the theme of the pack, so that they can also be used to play Top Trumps, which in German is sometimes known as Supertrumpf, and sometimes include a Schwarzer Peter (Black Peter) card so that they can be used for the German equivalent of Old Maid.\nOther Web Pages and Software\nThe site Cribbage.ca has a description of a French Canadian variation known as Merci, which is similar to Go Fish except that 10 cards each are dealt, and a player who forgets to say "merci" (thank you) when being given the requested cards must return the cards and the turn passes to the player who was asked.\nThe collection \nHOYLE Card Games for Windows or Mac OS X  includes a Go Fish program, along with many other popular card games.\nRobert Schultz\'s World of Card Games offers an online Go Fish game.\nThe Softgame Company\'s Funcrd Card Games program plays hearts, Spades, Cribbage and Go Fish.\nAt SolitaireOnline.com you can play Go Fish or Quartet on line against the server.\nMike\'s Cards includes a Go Fish program for Macintosh and Windows computers.\nGames4All has published a free Go Fish app for the Android platform, and also a SugarKidsClub version for the Dutch diabetes association DVN.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Quartet Group > Go Fish / Quartet\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1996, 2003, 2012.

The play is similar to 500 Rummy in that a player may take several cards from the discard pile, but there two major differences.\n\nThe first card dealt to each player is face up, and its value determines that number of cards the player will be dealt. The players therefore start with unequal sized hands.\nThere are wild cards, which along with the aces have a high value, typically 100 points. It is therefore important to meld these high-value cards, or at least to dispose of them before the end of the play. One wild card is determined by an exposed card in the dealer\'s hand, and therefore varies from deal to deal. Some versions have additional wild cards.\n\nI have collected over 25 descriptions of this game from different players, and no two of them agree in every detail. The variants affect every part of the game: the number of cards used, the deal, the card values, the wild cards, the melds that are allowed, the rules of play and the scoring. I will try to cover these variants by first describing a game that uses the commonest version of each rule, and then listing the variants I have seen.\nThe name 5000 Rummy reflects the fact that the game is often played to a target score of 5000, but many players use other targets and the game may be named accordingly: 1500 Rummy,  2000 Rummy, 2200 Rummy, 2500 Rummy, 2800 Rummy or 10000 Rummy. Other names include Backwards Rummy, Bitchin\' Rummy, Circle Rummy, Crazy Rummy (though this name is more commonly used for a different variant with fixed hand sizes), Dumbbell Rummy, Dummy Rummy, George, Hillbilly Rummy, Polish Rummy and Wild One. I would like to thank the many contributors who over several years have sent me descriptions of these different versions of this game.\nPlayers and Cards\n3 or 4 players use a standard 52-card pack; from 5 to 8 players use two 52-card packs (104 cards) shuffled together. Deal and play are clockwise.\nDeal\nThe first dealer is chosen by a random method: for example all draw cards and the lowest deals. The turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. Before the deal, the dealer shuffles and the player to dealer\'s right cuts the cards.\nInstead of dealing the cards around the table one or a few at a time as in many games, the dealer gives each player in turn their whole hand of cards before moving on to the next player. For each player, starting to the dealer\'s left:\n\nThe dealer deals one card in front of the player, face up for all to see. The rank of this card determines the number of additional cards that player will be dealt.\nThe dealer  deals the remainder of the player\'s hand face down. For example if a player\'s first card is a 7, the dealer gives the player 7 more cards face down before moving on to the next player. A player whose first card is a picture (jack, queen, king) receives 10 more cards: if the first card is an ace, the player receives 11 more cards.\n\nThe dealer will be the last to receive cards. The dealer\'s first (face up) card is wild for the current deal. For example if the dealer gets a 4 face up, the dealer takes four more cards face down, and fours are wild.\nThe dealer stacks the remainder of the cards in a neat face down pile to form a stock from which cards can be drawn. The top card of the stock is turned face up and placed next to the stock to begin the discard pile.\nAll players pick up their cards, both the face up one and the face down ones, and play begins.\nMelds\nAs in all forms of rummy, the aim is to form combinations: sets of three or more equal cards and runs of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.\n\nSets\nA set consists of three or more cards of the same rank, for example three kings or five sevens. When this game ifs played with more than one deck, a set may contain identical cards, so for example 5-5-5 is a valid set.\nRuns\nA run consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. For this purpose, the cards rank in order A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A. The ace can therefore be at the low end of a run, next to the 2, or at the high end next to the king, but not in the middle of a run.\n\nA wild card can be used as a substitute for any missing card needed to form a set or run. For example if 6\'s are wild, 8-6-10 is a valid run.\nPlay\nThe player to dealer\'s left begins, and players take turns in clockwise order around the table. A turn consists of three parts:\n\nThe player either draws the top card from the stock or takes one or more cards from the top of the discard pile. The card or cards taken are added to the player\'s hand. A player is always allowed to draw the top card from the stock or the discard pile. A player can draw more than one card from the discard pile provided that\n    \nthe deepest buried card that is taken is melded in the current turn, and\nthe player also takes all cards that are on top of (discarded later than) this deepest buried card.\n\n    A player who takes more than one card from the discard pile can meld some or all of the cards that were on top of the deepest buried card; the remainder of the cards taken are added to the player\'s hand.\nThe player may lay down (meld) valid runs and sets, and cards that extend runs and sets that have already been laid down by any player. Melded cards are always kept face up in front of the player who melded them, for scoring purposes. When adding to a set or run put down by another player, you must state which set or run you are adding it to, and the other players need to take notice of this. For example if player A has melded 6-7-8 and player B had added 9 to it, other players need to be aware that a 5 or a 10 can now be added (but not another 9), even though the 9 on the table is lying in front of player B and not  next to player A\'s  run.\nTo end the turn, the player must discard one card face up onto the discard pile. If a player takes just one card from the top of the discard pile, it is not legal to discard that same card, leaving the discard pile exactly as it was before the player\'s turn. The cards of the discard pile are overlapped, so that all can be seen.\n\n\nWild cards\nIf you hold the real card that is represented by a wild card that has been used in a run, you may meld the real card in step 2 of your turn, placing it in front of yourself. The wild card remains in place. \nCalling "rummy"\nAny card can be discarded. However, if a card is discarded which can be used to extend a set or run on the table, any player who has already melded can call "rummy", take the discard and meld it, announcing the set or run it is added to, and discard a card (if possible). The turn to play then reverts to the player whose turn to play should have been next had it not been for the "rummy" call.\nEnd of the play\nThe play can end in one of two ways:\n    \nA player has only one card left after melding and discards it, so having no cards left in hand. This is called "going out". Note that this final discard must be "unplayable": it cannot be a card that could have been added to a meld on the table. A player who has no unplayable cards has to "float" - see below.\nThere are no cards left in the stock pile, and the player whose turn it is cannot or does not wish to take a card or cards from the discard pile. \n\n\nIn either case, the play ends immediately and the hand is scored. \nFloating\nIf a player melds all his or her cards, and has nothing to discard, this does not end the play. Instead, the player "floats", holding no cards. In future turns, the player must draw a card from the stock (not from the discard pile since it is illegal to draw and discard the same card). If the card drawn is playable it must be melded and the player floats again. If it is not playable, the player discards it and goes out. A player who calls "rummy" while floating melds the card but is unable to discard, so continues to float.\n\nScoring\nPlayers score the value of all the cards they have melded. For this purpose:\n\nAces and wild cards are worth 100 points each, provided that aces are not wild;\nIf aces are wild, they are worth 200 points each;\nKings, Queens, Jacks and Tens are worth 10 points each if not wild;\nNumeral cards from 2 to 9 are worth 5 points each if not wild.\n\nAlso, if the play ended by one of the players going out, that player scores the value of all the cards remaining in the other players\' hands, which they failed to meld.\nFurther deals are played until one or more players reaches a cumulative score of 5000 or more. At that point, the player who has most points is the winner.\nVariations\nThere are numerous variations of this game: no two descriptions that I have seen agree in every detail. Below I have tried to list all the variants I have seen. Please note that some combinations of variants work better together than others, and in some places I have noted which variants should or should not be combined.\nCards, Wild Cards and Card Values\nDepending on exactly how the deal is managed, there is the possibility that some players may begin with  hands of only 3 or even 2 cards, which may be undesirable. To avoid this, some groups omit some small cards from the pack. It seems to be quite common to play without twos, so that a double deck contains 96 cards. Some take this further: I have seen variants played with 244 cards, where the lowest card is a 4, and with 2 or more decks of 36 cards containing nothing below a 6. If low cards are omitted, aces are always high in runs, next to the king.\nAnother way to avoid the smallest hands is to make all the twos permanent wild cards. In this case a player who receives a two as an upcard will be dealt another 15 or 20 cards, according to what dealing variant is used.\nMany players add jokers to the deck. These act as permanent wild cards. Some groups have other permanent wild cards such as tens or one-eyed jacks.\nTo reduce the chances of running out of cards some players add extra decks. For example three or four players can play with a double deck (with 4 jokers if used) and five or more could use a triple deck (with 6 jokers if wanted).\nSome players have a lower value of 50 for aces. If aces are 50 and wild cards are 100, then wild aces would normally be worth 150, but some groups do not allow aces to be wild - see below. Some play that wild cards are always worth 200, whether they are aces or not, and that aces are 100 when not wild. \nSome groups value 9\'s and 8\'s as 10 points instead of 5. Some have special high values for other particular cards, for example 45 for the queen of spades.\nDealing and Choosing the Wild Card\nSome groups treat the face up card dealt to each player as indicating the total number of cards that player should receive, rather than the number of additional cards. In this version, for example, a player who was dealt a 6 first would get only 5 cards face down, not 6.\nIn some groups a jack indicates 11 cards, a queen 12 cards and a king 13 cards, rather than pictures all indicating 10 cards. Some give 14 or 15 cards rather than 11 for an ace.\nWhen permanent wild cards are used, they usually correspond to a larger number of cards, such as 15, 20 or even 25. Alternatively, some play that a wild card dealt as an upcard is buried in the pack and replaced by another card. One description with 2\'s as permanent wild cards says that the player receiving a 2 can choose whether to be dealt 2 or 12 cards in total.\nSome avoid dealing hands with very few cards by burying any small card dealt as an upcard - for example if a 2, 3 or 4 is dealt it is buried and replaced. \nSome groups determine the wild card for the hand by exposing the dealer\'s last card rather than the first card. Some determine the wild card by an extra card dealt face up to the dealer, after the number of cards indicated by the dealer\'s initial upcard have been dealt. \nIf the indicator card is a permanent wild card, some give the dealer additional cards until a card that is not a permanent wild card is found. Others bury the permanent wild card in the deck and deal a replacement indicator card.\nIn one description the wild card for the hand is determined by a separate card dealt after the dealer\'s hand is complete: this indicator card is not used in the game: it does not belong to the dealer, nor is it part of the discard pile.\nRules of Play\nThe play mechanism is essentially similar to that of 500 Rummy, and all the variants of 500 Rummy play can in principle be used in this game as well. \nSome groups have restrictions on the use of wild cards in melds. Some play that the number of natural cards in a meld must always be greater than the number of wild cards. Some play that only one wild card is allowed in a meld, but that a meld of six cards or more can be split into two parts, so that one wild card can be used in each. When playing with these restrictions, players need to agree to how to treat wild cards that represent themselves: for example if sixes are wild, some treat the run 6-7-8 as already containing a wild card, while other groups treat the six as natural since it is the correct value and suit to fit into the run, even though it keeps its "wild" value of 100 points.\nSome players recognise a set of three or more wild cards as a special kind of combination, which can be extended only by adding further wild cards.\nSome allow the real card that a wild card represents in a meld to be traded for the wild card. That is, during the melding part of on\'s turn, one can play the card that corresponds to a wild card on the table, take that wild card and meld it elsewhere or add it to one\'s hand.\nSome require a player who takes more than one card from the discard pile to meld the deepest buried card along with two natural cards from the player\'s hand.\nSome always require the card taken from the discard pile to be melded, even when only the top card is taken.\nMany groups play that a player cannot \'lay off\' cards, adding them to other players\' melds on the table, until after they have melded at least one set or run of their own. Having melded a set or run, a player can then lay off single cards in the same or subsequent turns.\nSome do not allow players to call \'rummy\' when a playable card is discarded. \nOne the other hand, some allow a player to call \'rummy\' when any meld can be made or added to using cards anywhere in the discard pile. This is known as \'rummy in the pile\'. The calling player must take all the cards above the deepest card in the pile that is being melded. This rule is not recommended.\nIn the variant known by some as  George and by others as 2500 Rummy, no runs can be melded, only sets of equal cards. A set can contain at most one wild card, and cards can only be taken from the discard pile when a player has two natural cards in hand that match the deepest buried card that is taken. This version is usually played with a double 48-card pack without twos, and a player\'s first card indicates the total number of cards to be dealt to the player, counting jack as 11, queen 12, king 13, ace 14 or 15.\nEnding the Play and Scoring\nSome allow a player to go out by melding all his or her cards, leaving no card to discard.\nSome play that if a player goes out while one or more other players are floating, the floating player(s) must draw one card from the stock.\nSome play that if a player goes out on his or her first turn to play, any other players who have not yet played take one turn before the hand is scored. If another player also goes out, any bonus for going out is given to the first player who did so.\nWhen scoring, some play that instead of giving unmelded cards to the winner to score, each player subtracts the value of the cards remaining in his or her hand from the amount scored for melded cards. In this version scores will be lower and a player can have a negative score. With this type of scoring some add a bonus of, for example, 200 points to the score of the player who went out.\nThe game ends when a player reaches or exceeds the target score, which may be set at 1500, 2000, 2200, 2500, 2800, 5000 or even 10000. Clearly a higher target leads to a longer game, but the game length is also strongly affected by the card values. Games with permanent wild cards are higher scoring so a higher target is appropriate. Also, games in which unmelded cards are given to the player who goes out are higher scoring and a higher target is appropriate than for a game in which unmelded cards are deducted from the owner\'s score, especially if there is no bonus for going out.\nSome play that if more than one player reaches the target in the same deal, the winner of the game is not the player with the highest score, but the player who went out on that final deal, provided that that player has reached the target. If the player who went out is below the target, then the  highest score among the players who have reached the target wins, and if there is a tie for highest score the tying players are joint winners.\nOther Web Sites\nThis game, although evidently quite popular in North America, is surprisingly little documented: so far as I have noticed it is not described in any of the standard card game books.\nHere are archive copies of Jim Davidson\'s former web pages on  5000 Rummy and 10,000 Rummy.\nAnother description of 5000 Rummy can be found on the Thirtysomething Gamers site.\nThe variant known as George, without runs, appeared in the Anyone for Cards package for Windows 3.1, published in 1993.\nContributors\nI would like to thank the many people, some of them wholly or partly anonymous, who have sent me descriptions of versions of this game.

To win the pot at the showdown you need to have the lowest set of cards with no two cards of the same rank or suit, ace ranking low. The best possible hand is therefore A-2-3-4 with one card of each suit.\nThere is some controversy over the origin of this game, which has been played at least since the 1980\'s. Bill Rosmus reports that in the 1980\'s in Winnipeg, Canada it was played under the name Off Suit Lowball in the back room of pool halls and back \n      room poker clubs. Bryan Micon says he has been told by several Korean players that it was also played in South Korea in the 1980\'s. Nick Wedd reports that the Korean word baduk, or badug refers to a black and white \n      pattern.  This gives rise to the Korean name baduk for the board game Go, played with black and white stones. In Korea, if you have a black and white pet dog, you might well give it the name "badugi". \n      Two high-low games featuring the "doogie" hand, a low four-card hand consisting of a different ranked card of each suit, were contributed to pagat.com in 2000 by  Bob Procter\'s poker group in North Carolina, and published on pagat.com in 2002: Doogie and Buddys Game. They have suggested that the "doogie" hand may have been named after  the TV character Doogie Howser. Badugi started to become well-known in the USA around 2004, popularised by Paul "Eskimo" Clark, who was a friend of at least one player from Bob Procter\'s group.\nAny solid information on the history of Badugi or Off Suit Lowball before 1980 would be of great interest in helping to establish how old the game really is, and whether it was invented in  Korea or North America, or even independently in both places.\nThe following explanation of how to play Badugi assumes that you are familiar with the general rules of poker.\nPlayers, Cards and Hand Ranking\nBadugi can be played by from 2 to 8 players, using a standard 52-card pack. The cards rank from Ace (low) up to King (high).\nWhen comparing hands, within each hand all the cards  must be different in suit and rank. If a player has more than one card of a suit, or two or more cards of matching rank, some cards must be eliminated to create a valid hand. Examples:\n\n5-9-3-J: only one diamond can be used so this is a three-card hand J-5-3.\n7-4-A-4: only one four can be used so this is also a three-card hand 7-4-A.\n3-6-8-6: eliminating the 6  makes a valid three-card hand 8-6-3.\n3-6-8-3: in this case two cards must be removed - a club and a three - leaving a two-card hand 6-3.\n10-10-10-8: this is another two-card hand 10-8.\n6-5-4-2: only one heart can be used, so this is a one-card hand: 2.\n8-K-5-Q: this is is a four-card hand, also known as a badugi, though not a particularly good one K-Q-8-5.\n\nThe rules for comparing hands are:\n\nAny hand with more cards beats a hand with fewer cards. So a badugi beats any three-card hand, which beats any two-card hand, which beats any one-card hand.\nBetween hands with the same number of cards, compare the highest card. The hand with the lower top card is better.\nIf the highest cards of equal sized hands are equal, compare the second highest card, and the lower card wins. If these are also equal compare the third highest card (if present), and then the fourth highest.\nIf two hands have the same number of cards and the ranks of the cards are the same, the hands are equal. There is no ranking of suits.\n\nExamples:\n\n8-7-5-4 beats 9-4-3-2 because 8 is lower than 9.\n10-7-5-4 beats 10-7-6-A because 5 is lower than 6.\nK-Q-J-8 beats 3-2-A because any four cards beat any three cards.\nIf one player has 5-3-5-3 and another has K-Q-3-5 their hands are equal. These both reduce to two-card hands 5-3. The ranks of the unused cards and the suits of the cards are not considered. If these are the best two hands in the showdown the players split the pot.\n\nDeal, Draw and Betting\nBadugi can be played as a fixed limit, pot limit or half pot limit game - see the betting page for explanation. As in any poker game, the turn to deal (or to have the dealer button if therte is a non-playing dealer) passes clockwise after each hand. If there are more than two players, the player to dealer\'s left places a small blind, and the next player to the left places a big blind, which is normally twice as big as the small blind. In a "heads up" (two player) game, the dealer places a small blind and the dealer\'s opponent a big blind.\nThe dealer deals four cards to each player, clockwise, face down, one at a time, and the players look at their hands. There is then a betting round, begun by the player to the left of the big blind. The minimum bet is normally equal to the big blind. If none of the other players does more than call, the player who placed the big blind is allowed to bet.\nThe players have three opportunities to improve their hands by drawing cards. Starting with the first active player to dealer\'s left, and continuing clockwise arounf the dealer, each player states how many cards he or she wishes to exchange, discards that number of cards face down to the muck (discard pile), and is immediately given an equal number of replacement cards face down by the dealer. Players can exchange any number of cards from zero to four: excahnging no cards is known as "standing pat".\nAfter each round of drawing, when each active player has had an opportunity to draw cards, there is a new betting round, begun by the first active player to the left of the dealer. There are therefore up to four betting rounds altogether: before the first draw and after each of the three rounds of drawing. In a fixed limit game, the size of the bet doubles after the second draw, so that the third and fourth betting rounds are played with big bets.\nShowdown \nIf at any stage only one active player remains, that player takes the pot without showing any cards.\nIf there is more than one active player at the end of the last betting round, there is a showdown in which the active players display their cards in turn, beginning with the last player who bet or raised in the final betting round, or with the first active player to dealer\'s left if all checked in the final betting round.\nPlayers show all four cards, even if because of duplicate ranks or suits they only have a three-card, two-card or one-card hand. The cards speak for themselves, and the holder of the best hand wins the pot. If two or more players tie for best hand they divide the pot equally between them.\nOther Badugi web sites\nA Badugu strategy guide is available on the playlowballpoker website.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Badugi\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2010, 2011, 2012.

This page is based mainly on information from the Austrian Shang Shung Institute, which formerly published a set of rules on their web site and sold the tiles for the game.\n Bagchen is an expanded version of the Chinese game Tien Gow (Sky Nine): it uses the same division of the tiles into two suits and similar ranking within the suits. As in Tien Gow the main objective is to win the last trick, and it is possible to lead combinations of dominoes, in which case a multiple trick is played.\nWhen written out, the rules of this game look rather complicated, and new players may be discouraged at first by the need to memorise the seemingly arbitrary ranking of the tiles. Those of us who have tried it can reassure you that the effort is worthwhile. It is not as difficult to learn as you might expect, and once you master the rules, the game goes quite quickly and is very enjoyable to play.\n\n\nPlayers and equipment\nBagchen is for four players, with no partnerships. Play is clockwise.\n A set of 64 dominoes is needed. This consists of:\n\nfour each of the tiles [6-6], [1-1], [4-4], [3-1], [5-5], [3-3], [2-2], [6-5], [6-4], [6-1], [5-1];\ntwo each of the tiles [6-3], [5-4], [6-2], [5-3], [5-2], [4-3], [4-2], [4-1], [3-2], [2-1].\n\nTwo six-sided dice are also needed. Ideally Tibetan dominoes and dice should be used: the tiles are similar in size and shape to Mah Jong tiles. The illustrated set came in a plastic case labelled in Chinese  (Zng pi), which just means "Tibetan tiles". When looking for sets to buy it is worth searching under various spellings such Bagchen, Pagchen, Bakchen or Pakchen. Pagchen sets are available from the USA online store of the Shang Shung institute. Sets can also be bought in  Lhasa: many of them are manufactured in Hong Kong.\nIf you have no Tibetan dominoes, it is possible to play with two 32-tile sets of ordinary Chinese dominoes and two Chinese dice, or even to make up an equivalent, though less authentic set from four 6-6 sets of Western dominoes and two Western dice.\n It is convenient to use chips for scoring. Each player should begin with an equal number of these.\nOutline of play\nAll the tiles are distributed to the players as described below, so that each has 16. The tiles are played in single or multiple tricks as follows. One player leads a tile or set of tiles, placing them face up in the middle of the table, side by side. The next player to the left must play an equal number of tiles. If they beat the tiles on display, they are placed face up on top of those tiles. If not, they are placed face down under the tiles previously played to the trick. Then the third player, opposite the player who led, must play in the same way, and finally the fourth player. When all four players have played, the trick is complete. There will be a stack of tiles in the middle of the table, which will be four tiles high and one, two, three or more tiles wide, depending on how many tiles were led. The winning tile or set of tiles will be face up on top of the stack. The person who played this winning tile or set takes the stack, stores it to his or her left alongside any previously won stacks, and leads a tile or set of tiles to the next trick. When more than one tile is led, the resulting stack counts as that number of tricks, so there are always 16 tricks in all.\n As a part of the dealing process the two dice are thrown, and this throw designates four tiles which are known as points for the duration of the play. A point tile cannot beat any other tile, but if it is led nothing can beat it. Moreover, a player who leads a point tile is immediately paid by the other players.\n The player who leads to a trick is subject to certain constraints on what tiles or sets of tiles can be played. These will be explained below. Any of the other three players who choose to play face down are under no constraint except that they must play same number of tiles as the player who led: they can play any tiles that they wish to get rid of, without any requirement to follow suit. A player who wants to play face up and potentially win the trick can only do so by playing a tile or combination that beats what is currently face up on top of the trick, as described in the next section. \n The play continues until all the tiles have been played. Then the player who won the final trick is paid by (or in some cases pays) the other players according to the number of tiles they have won. If the last trick is won with a point tile, the payments are multiplied by a factor which depends on the number of consecutive tricks at the end that are won with points. The greatest rewards in the game are won this way, but the player who attempts to win with points at the end runs a greater risk of losing instead. \n The detailed procedures for distributing the tiles, winning tricks and calculating payments will be described in the following sections. \nSuits, ranking and combinations\nThe dominoes are divided into two unequal suits, sky and earth. The sky suit has eleven different tiles, with four copies of each  44 tiles in all. The earth suit has only 20 tiles, consisting of ten identical pairs. The ranking of tiles within each suit is as follows:\n\n\n\nSky\nEarth\n\n\n\nSky chief\n[6-6]\n[6-3] = [5-4]\nEarth chief (nine)\n\n\nSky minister\n[1-1]\n[6-2] = [5-3]\nEarth minister (eight)\n\n\nLama\n[4-4]\n[5-2] = [4-3]\nSeven\n\n\nBird\n[3-1]\n[4-2]\nMother\n\n\nSisters\n[5-5] [3-3] [2-2]\n[4-1] = [2-3]\nFive (Owl)\n\n\nPeople\n[6-5] [6-4] [6-1] [5-1]\n[2-1]\nSon\n\n\nAny single tile can be led. A tile can be beaten only by a higher tile of the same suit. Sky tiles cannot beat earth tiles and earth tiles cannot beat sky tiles. So for example a [5-3] can only be beaten by a [6-3] or a [5-4]: not by a [6-6] because it is the wrong suit, and not by a [6-2] because it is equal, not higher. A sister, such as [3-3], can only be beaten by a [6-6], [1-1], [4-4] or [3-1]. A [5-1] can be beaten by those tiles or by any sister, but not by another people tile such as [6-5] and not by any earth tile.\n It is necessary to understand which combinations of tiles can be led together, and which combinations can beat other combinations.\nOrdinary combinations\nAny set of two, three or four identical sky tiles can be led together. Such a combination can only be beaten by an equal sized higher identical set of sky tiles. For example [6-4][6-4][6-4] can be beaten by [2-2][2-2][2-2] or [1-1][1-1][1-1] but not by [2-2][3-3][3-3] or [6-6][4-4][3-1] (not identical) and not by [6-5][6-5][6-5] (not higher) and not by [6-6][6-6] (wrong number of tiles).\n Any set of two, three or four equal (but not necessarily identical) earth tiles can be led together. Such a combination can only be beaten by an equal sized higher set of equal earth tiles. For example [4-3][5-2] can be led together, and can be beaten by [6-2][6-2] or [6-3][5-4] but not by [6-3][6-2] (not equal) and not by [6-6][6-6] (wrong suit).\nMixed chiefs and mixed ministers\nAny set of two or more ministers can be led together. They can only be beaten by an equal sized combination of chiefs, containing the same numbers of sky and earth tiles as the ministers to be beaten. For example, [1-1][6-2][5-3] can be led, and can be beaten by [6-6][5-4][5-4], but not by [6-6][6-6][6-3] (wrong mixture of sky and earth).\n Any set of chiefs can be led together and cannot be beaten. \n Below the rank of minister no combinations of mixed sky and earth are allowed. This is a difference from Tien Gow  for example in Bagchen [4-4][5-2] is not a legal combination to lead.\nMother and son\nMother and son form a special combination [4-2][2-1]. This combination cannot beat anything, but these two tiles can be led together, and when led together they cannot be beaten. Mother and son led together also count as a point (see below). \nMare, stallion and complete horse\n[4-1][2-1] is the mare and [4-3][4-2] is the stallion. Either of these combinations can be led. The mare can only be beaten by the stallion, and the stallion cannot be beaten at all.\n Mare and stallion together form the complete horse [4-3][4-2][4-1][2-1]. This four-tile combination cannot beat anything but when led it cannot be beaten. Although it contains the mother and the son, it is not a point. \n It is also possible to lead a double mare or double stallion (four tiles each). A double stallion beats a double mare. A double mare does not beat anything and a double stallion cannot be beaten.\nPoints\nPoints are special tiles or combinations which cannot beat anything but cannot be beaten when led. A player who leads a point not only automatically wins the trick, forcing the other players to play tiles face down, but is also paid by the other players. Winning the last trick with a point is especially profitable.\n The point for each deal is determined by throwing the two dice. The tile thereby indicated is removed from the normal hierarchy of tiles and becomes a point. There are always four point tiles determined this way:\n\nif the dice designate a sky tile, the four identical tiles of this value become points;\nif the dice designate an earth tile, all the earth tiles of equal value to it become points  for example if 6 and 2 are thrown, both the [6-2] tiles and the [5-3] tiles are points;\nif the dice designate either mother (4 and 2) or son (2 and 1) then both the mother tiles and both the son tiles are points.\n\nIt is possible to lead two or more point tiles together, but a combination cannot consist partly of point and partly of non-point tiles. This, together with the fact that point tiles cannot beat or be beaten, has the following consequences.\n\nIf 6-6 is the point, [1-1] and mixed ministers are unbeatable.\nIf 5-4 or 6-3 is the point, [6-2], [5-3] and mixed ministers are unbeatable.\nIf 1-1, 6-2 or 5-3 is the point, mixed ministers cannot be played.\nIf 7 of earth (4-3 or 5-2) is the point, the stallion ([4-2]+[4-3]) cannot be played and mare ([4-1]+[2-1]) is therefore unbeatable. Also the complete horse ([4-3]+[4-2]+[4-1]+[2-1]) cannot be played.\nIf 5 of earth (4-1 or 3-2) is the point, neither the mare ([4-1]+[2-1]) nor the complete horse ([4-3]+[4-2]+[4-1]+[2-1]) can be played.\nIf mother (4-2) or son (2-1) is the point, stallion, mare and complete horse are all unplayable.\n\nIn addition to the point determined by the dice throw, mother and son are always a point when led together. If mother and son are points in their own right they can still be led together, and in this case they count as three points: one for each tile and one for the combination.\nProcedure for choosing seats and the starting player\nIf you follow the authentic formal procedure, the allocation of seats depends on the throw of dice and the time of day. All four players in turn throw the two dice. If it is morning, the player who throws the highest total sits in the East seat, the second highest sits South, the third highest sits West and the lowest North. If it is after noon the player who throws lowest sits East, the second lowest South, the second highest West and the highest North. If two or more players throw the same number, they throw again to decide which of them is higher.\n East is the starting player for the first hand. Subsequently, the player who wins each hand is the starting player for the next. \n Alternatively, in an informal game, the players may sit anywhere they choose, and they throw dice only to determine who will start the first hand. Any player throws the dice and the total on the dice is counted clockwise starting with this player. The player on whom the count ends throws the dice again, and again the total is counted around the players. The player on whom this second count ends is the starting player for the first hand. Example: South throws 5-2; the count of 7 ends at North; North throws 4-4; the count of 8 ends at West; West is the starting player. \nThe deal\nThe tiles are placed face town on the table and shuffled thoroughly. Then each player builds a wall four tiles long and four tiles high, and divides it into two towers four high and two wide. The eight towers, two in front of each player, form an octagon  see diagram.\n The player opposite the starting player (i.e. West in the first hand of a formal game) chooses which tower will be taken first, points to it without touching it and then throws the two dice. The numbers thrown determine the point for the hand and are also use to decide who will take the first tiles. The player who threw the dice counts around the players clockwise, starting with himself, from 1 up to the total on the dice, and the player with whom the count ends takes the chosen tower. The next player to the left takes the next tower in clockwise order and so on until everyone has 16 tiles (two towers).\n For example if South is the starting player, and North throws 6 and 4 then [6-4] is the point for this hand and East takes the tower chosen by North (because the count to 10 ends with East). If South had thrown 4 and 1 then both [4-1] and [3-2] would have been points (since 4-1 belongs to the earth suit) and North would have taken the chosen tower.\n Players arrange their 16 tiles in front of them in such a way that they can see their faces but their opponents cannot. The two dice remain on the table displaying the point until the end of the hand, and must be returned to that state after being used for any other purpose. \n There are three further possible steps before the play begins.\nDemanding a re-deal\nA player who has a very poor hand may demand a re-deal. Very poor means no tile of the highest or second highest rank in each suit. Points are not counted as high tiles, since they do not beat anything, so if the point is 6-6 or 1-1, the [4-4] is the second highest sky tile, and if the point is 6-3, 5-4, 6-2 or 5-3, sevens ([5-2] and [4-3]) are the second highest earth tile for this purpose. So there are always 16 tiles that disqualify a player from demanding a re-deal. \n A player who has none of these 16 tiles may, if he wishes, expose all his tiles to prove that he has no high ones. The shuffling and dealing process must then be repeated (with the same starting player as before). \nFour chiefs of sky\nIf one player has all four chiefs of sky (all the [6-6] tiles) and they are not points, he or she must expose these tiles to the other players. The game continues, and the other players can adjust their strategy in the light of this information.\nUniting mothers and sons\nIf one player has a mother [4-2] and another a son [2-1], they may be brought together, if both players agree to do so, provided that the mother and son are not points, by the following method. Any player who holds a [4-2] may place it face up on the table saying mother looking for son, upon which anyone who holds a [2-1] can accept the offer by also putting it face up on the table. Or similarly the holder of a [2-1] can show it, saying son looking for mother and the holder of a mother can accept the offer. \n When an offer is accepted, each of the two players throws one die, and the player who throws higher takes both tiles. (If they throw equal numbers, both throw again.) Now the player who threw lower has only 15 tiles. This player throws both dice, and the other player, who has 17 tiles, must if possible give the tile indicated by the dice to the player who has 15, unless the indicated tile is the mother, the son or the point. If the dice indicate an earth tile that the 17-tile player does not have, the equivalent tile must be given instead  for example [4-3] if 5-2 was thrown and the player does not have a [5-2]. If the throw was a point, a mother, a son, a sky tile that the 17-tile player does not have, or an earth tile for which the 17-tile player does not have an equivalent, the dice must be thrown again until they indicate a tile that can be given. After this the dice must be reset to show the point which was determined during the deal.\n Example. The point is 6-2. South places a [2-1] face up: son looking for mother. West accepts by placing a [4-2] face up. South throws 3 and West throws 4. West takes the mother and son. West throws 5-3 but this is a point. West tries again and throws 5-5 but South does not have a [5-5]. West next throws 4-2 but that is mother. Then West throws 5-4. South does not have a [5-4] but does hold a [6-3]. South must give a [6-3] to West.\n If one player has both mothers and another player has both sons, they can agree to exchange one of these tiles without throwing dice so that each of them has a mother and son combination.\n Note that if the point is 4-2 or 2-1, there can be no exchanging of mothers and sons.\nThe Play\nThe starting player leads any single tile or any legal combination of tiles, placing them side by side face up on the table. The other players, in clockwise order, must play the same number of tiles that were led. They have two options:\n\nPlay a tile or combination that beats the highest tile or      combination so far played, putting it face up on top of the tiles that      were previously winning.\nPlay the appropriate number of tiles face down, without showing      them to the other players, placing them under the stack of played tiles.\n\nA single tile can only be beaten by a higher single tile of the same suit, and an ordinary combination only by a higher combination of the same suit. Point tiles and certain special combinations cannot be beaten. Details are given in the suits, ranking and combinations section above.\n When everyone has played to the trick, the tiles will be stacked four high with the winning tile or combination on top. These stacked tiles are placed to the winners left, and count as one, two or more tricks depending on the number of tiles that were led. The winner of the trick(s) leads to the next trick.\nPassport\nA player who has won six or more tricks is said to have a passport. This player is exempt from all future payments during the hand, but may still receive payments, including a payment from the winner of the last trick if the passport holder ends with seven or more tricks.\n On the other hand, a player with a passport is subject to extra constraints on what tiles can be led to a trick. These constraints are designed to make it hard for this player to win the last trick. Note that these constraints only apply when playing first to a trick: if you lost the previous trick and another player is leading, you are free to play any tiles you wish as usual, even if you have a passport.\n The following tiles and sets may always be led:\n\nAny unbeatable tile or combination, including any points. When      deciding whether a tile is unbeatable, tiles previously played face up are      taken into account. So for example if two [6-3] tiles and a [5-4] have      been played and 6-2 is the point, then a set of [5-2]+[4-3] is unbeatable      and can therefore be led by a passport holder.\nAny set of mixed ministers (provided of course that no      ministers are points)\nAny set of two or more sky tiles except the lowest ones (so a      for example pair of [3-3] is OK but a pair of [6-5] is not)\nA passport holder whose hand consists only of points together with just one tile or combination can lead this tile or combination, keeping only points.\n\nThe following leads are additionally allowed if the passport holder does not hold any chiefs ([6-6], [6-3], [5-4]) that are not points:\n\nAny special combination (including the mare: [4-1][2-1], which      may be beatable)\nAny sky combination, even of the lowest sky tiles such as      [6-1][6-1] or [6-5][6-5].\n\nA passport holder who has no unbeatable tiles, no set of sky tiles and no special combinations may lead a combination two or more equal earth tiles, and must expose his or her tiles on request.\n A passport holder who has to lead to a trick, but has no unbeatable tiles and no combinations at all must expose his or her tiles to the other players, laying them all face up. If they are all the same suit, the passport holder may lead any of them. If they include both earth and sky the passport holder must throw the two dice to choose a suit: earth or sky. The player may then lead any tile of the suit indicated by the dice, after which the dice must be reset to show the point for the current hand.\nCharity\nA player without a passport may lead a single tile face down, and optionally name a suit (earth or sky). The tile played is not revealed and does not have to belong to the named suit. This face down tile can be beaten by any single tile of the named suit, or by any single tile at all if no suit was named.\n If all four players play face down, for example because the first player plays face down and nominates earth, but none of the other players has an earth tile that they wish to play, then the player of the first tile wins the trick.\nScoring\nIt is convenient to use chips for scoring since there are payments both during and at the end of the play.\nPayments during the play\nA player who wins a stack by playing a point tile is immediately paid one chip by each opponent who does not have a passport.\n If several stacks are won by leading several point tiles together, the player is of course paid a chip for each tile.\n Since the mother and son combination is a point, a player who leads these is immediately paid a chip by each opponent who does not have a passport. If the mother and son tiles are also point tiles in their own right, the payment is three chips instead of one  one for each tile and one for the combination.\nPayments after the last trick\nThe winner of the last trick settles up with the other players as follows.\n If the last trick was not won with a point:\n\nEach player who has fewer than six stacks must pay the      difference between six and the number of stacks they won. For example a      player with two stacks pays 4 chips to the winner of the last trick.\nA player with exactly six stacks neither pays nor receives      anything.\nA player with more than six stacks is paid one chip for each      stack over six. For example a player with 8 stacks is paid 2 chips by the      winner of the last trick.\n\nThe net result for the winner of the last trick will always be a profit of 2 plus the number of stacks this player won.\nJumps\nIf the last trick was won with a point, or a consecutive series of tricks at the end were won with points, this is called a jump. In this case, there are no single chip payments for these final points. Instead, all the final payments are multiplied by twice the number of points that the winner of the last trick played consecutively at the end. \n For example, if a player wins the third last stack with the [6-6] and then plays mother and son, winning the last two stacks, then a player with four stacks must pay 4 chips to the winner of the last trick instead of two.\n If [3-3] is the point, a player wins a double earth trick with the [6-3][5-4] and then produces [3-3][3-3][4-2][2-1] as his last four tiles, he has jumped with three points at the end, and the payments are therefore multiplied by six. A player with one stack must pay him 30 chips (235).\n Note that the maximum number of points potentially available in a deal is always six: four points determined by the dice and two mothers and sons. Therefore the maximum multiplying factor for the final payments is 12.\nSixteen Tricks\nA player who manages to win all sixteen tricks wins all the chips on the table, ending the game.\nEnding the Game\nTo end the session, one of the players can declare Gobah, after which five more deals are played, the final deal being known as Tashi Gobah. Alternatively, if time is short, players may agree to play just one more deal, the Tashi Gobah.\nCustoms \nExchanging Seats\nA player who considers that he or she is having a run of bad luck may try to change this by requiring a change of seats. This can be done immediately before the tiles are shuffled for a new hand. To determine the new seating everyone throws the dice as at the start of the session. The player who demanded the exchange of seats does not move, but the other three move as necessary so that the four players are sitting in decreasing order of dice throw counting clockwise in the morning or in increasing order clockwise in the afternoon. \nExchanging tiles\nAfter the deal but before looking at any of their tiles, any two players may agree to exchange hands.\nStoring dice and tricks\nTraditionally the dice showing the point are kept to the left of the starting player. Tricks are stored to the left of the player who won them, in a row that grows towards the centre of the table as tricks are added. They are placed there by the last player to the trick if he or she wins it, but otherwise by the player to the left of the one who won the trick.\nHint from the dice\nAny player who is not sure what to play may throw the two dice and interpret the result as a hint. The interpretation is up to the player. The dice must be reset after use to show the point for the current hand.\nOmens\nIf you hold three sky chiefs ([6-6]), it is a very bad omen if the player opposite you wins the last trick, so that you have to salute this player by throwing the dice for the next deal.\n Winning any of the final five hands after Gobah is declared is good luck, especially the very last hand (Tashi Gobah). Winning none of the five Gobah hands is an indicator of future bad luck.\nVariations\nPassport Rules\nIt is said that the exact rules for what can and cannot be led by a player with a passport vary from place to place, and this is easy to believe since they are rather elaborate. However, all the descriptions I have seen so far give the same passport rules, perhaps indicating that they all have a common source.\nJump scoring\nSome set the jump factor higher than 2, up to a maximum of 6. This must be agreed at the start of the session. For example with a factor of 4, then in case of a jump, the final payments are multiplied by four times the number of points played at the end.\nOther Bagchen Web Pages\nA detailed description can be found in this archive copy of the Bagchen rules page of the Shang Shung Institute for Tibetan Studies (SSI) in Austria. The rules there were written by Igor Berkhin, who learned the game from Chgyal Namkhai Norbu.\nHere is an archive copy of the Rules of Bag Chen which were published on the Digital Gamers (DG) site. They are said to have been pieced together from many sources, but unfortunately no references are given. They agree fairly closely with the SSI rules with a few exceptions. In the DG version mixed minister leads are restricted to a maximum of four tiles. Also the DG authors imply that it is compulsory to beat the highest tiles so far played to a trick when able to do so, but this is probably a misunderstanding: there is no such rule in the SSI version nor in the simpler game Tien Gow on which Bagchen is based.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Chinese Domino Games > Bagchen\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2005, 2011.

I am grateful to Joe Zeng, Shi Ji and others for further information about the game and its variants.\nDa3 Bai3 Fen1 means "contesting 100 points", which is the total number of card points in the pack. Often it is just called Bai3 Fen1 (100 points) and in English, the game could be called Hundred.  There are several alternative names. Formerly it was known in some places as Dui4 Zhu3 ( : playing with trumps). In Shanghai the game is called Si4shi2 Fen1 (), which means "40 points", 40 being the target score for the opponents. In Chengdu in Sichuan province it is called Shuan3 Er4 (), meaning "throw two", which is what you do during the first deal.\n\nIt is a trick taking game for four players in fixed partnerships, with considerable depth and scope for skill. The single deck game described on this page is gradually being supplanted, especially in southern China, by expanded versions using two or more  decks. These are described on the Tuolaji ( : Tractor) page. The name Sheng1 Ji2 (), which means "raise level" or "promote", refers to all the games of this family, using one or more decks. There is also a variation  Zhao Pengyou ( : Looking for Friends) for 6 to 12 players with variable partnerships. If you have more specific information about the distribution of either of these games, or variations of them played in particular regions, please let me know.\nPlayers and Cards\n\nDa bai fen is a point trick game played by four players in fixed partnerships, with partners facing each other across the table. A standard international pack is used, with red and black jokers, making 54 cards in all.  The point values of the cards are as follows:\n\n     Each King    10 points,\n     Each ten     10 points,\n     Each five     5 points,\n     Other cards   no value.\nRanking of Cards\n\nIn each hand there are eighteen trumps: the two jokers, all the cards of a particular suit (the trump suit) and all the cards of a particular rank (the trump rank).  The highest trump is the red Joker, second is the black Joker, and third is the card which belongs to both the trump suit and the trump rank.  Next come the other three cards of the trump rank, which are equal in status.  Finally there are the remaining cards of the trump suit which rank in downwards order A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (omitting the trump rank).  The three remaining suits also rank from highest to lowest A, K, Q, J, 10. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (omitting the trump rank). For example if sixes and clubs are trumps, the trump suit from high to low is:\nred joker, black joker, 6, [6/6/6 - all equal ], A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2.\n\nDeclarers and opponents\n\nIn each hand one partnership are declarers, sometimes known in Chinese as dang1 zhuang1 (), and the other are the opponents.  The declarers are chosen not by bidding but according to the result of the previous hand.  Normally if the declarers are successful they win a game point while if the opponents are successful they do not score but win the right to be the declarers in the next hand.  In extreme cases it is possible for the declarers to score more than one point or for the opponents to score in addition to becoming the declarers.  Each side\'s score in game points is expressed as a card rank from two (low) up to Ace (high).  Thus for example if a side with a score of ten gains two game points their score goes up to "Queen".  In each hand the trump rank is the declarers\' current score.  Both sides start at two and the winners are the first side whose score goes above Ace.\n\nThe Deal\n\nEach player receives twelve cards, but there is no dealer as such. One player, whom I shall call the starter, shuffles the cards and any other player may cut. The whole pack is then placed face down in the centre of the table and the players take turns to draw cards one at a time from the top of the pack.  The starter draws the first card, the player to the starter\'s right takes the second card, and so on in anti-clockwise rotation until everyone has twelve.  As you draw each card you look at it and can sort it into your hand.  It is important to follow this procedure, because a player can choose trumps in the middle of the deal on the basis of the cards picked up so far.\n\nThe trump rank for the hand is known in advance of the deal: for the first hand it must be two because both sides start with a score of two, and in subsequent hands it is the current score of the declarers.  Any player who draws a card of the trump rank during the deal may place it face up on the table, and its suit then becomes trumps for the hand. If you draw a card of the trump rank you need not show it immediately you draw it; you may keep it and expose at at any time provided that no other card has yet been exposed, or you may prefer never to expose it if you do not want its suit as trumps.  Consultation between partners is not allowed.\n\nAfter each player has drawn a hand of twelve cards there are six face-down cards left over.  If no one has yet exposed a card, the starter turns these cards face up one at a time in order.  Once the first of these cards is exposed it is too late for anyone to determine the trump suit by exposing one of their own cards.  If a card of the trump rank is found among the last six cards, its suit becomes trumps and no further cards are turned up.  If no card of the trump rank appears, the highest ranking of the six cards, excluding Jokers, determines the trump suit; among cards of equal rank the earliest exposed takes precedence.\n\nIn the first hand whichever player exposes a two (or the starter in the unlikely event that no one does) becomes the leader, and the leader\'s side become the declarers.  In subsequent hands the leader is the same player as the starter.  In either case the leader picks up the last six cards and adds them to his hand.  Apart from any of these cards which may already have been exposed in order to choose trumps, the cards picked up are not shown to the other players.  The leader then discards any six of his eighteen cards face down.  It is important to keep these discards separate from the trick piles.\n\nBefore the first lead any player who has no trumps at all in his hand may if he wishes expose his entire hand and claim a draw.  He is not allowed to consult his partner about this.  In this case all the cards are thrown in and there is a new deal, started by the partner of the leader to the annulled hand, in which any player may expose a card whose rank is equal to his side\'s score.  Whoever does this becomes the new leader and his side are the declarers.  It is not clear what should happen if no one exposes a card during this special deal, but I suggest that the hand should be treated as another draw and there should be another special deal; this will happen very rarely.\n\nThe Play\n\nDuring the play, Jokers and cards of the trump rank all count as belonging to the trump suit, not to the suits marked on them.  The leader leads to the first trick; thereafter the winner of a trick leads to the next.  A player may lead any single card, or a group of cards of the same suit, but if more than one card is led at once, all the cards led must be higher than any card of the suit led remaining in any player\'s hand.  If it turns out that anyone (even the partner of the one who led) holds a card of the suit led which beats any one of the cards of a multiple lead then the lead is a revoke.  The penalty for a revoke is that the hand is scored as though the offending side had lost every trick.  There is no restriction on single card leads.\n\nPlay is in anti-clockwise rotation.  Each of the other three players in turn must play the same number of cards as were led.  As far as possible they must play cards of the suit led.  Having run out of cards of the suit led a player may play any cards he chooses.  If one or more players play nothing but trumps to the trick, the trick is won by whichever of these played the highest trump.  Among trumps of equal rank the one which is played earliest beats the others.  If everyone plays at least one non-trump to the trick, it is won by the player of the highest card of the suit led.\n\nNote that for single card leads these rules are equivalent to the familiar trick-taking rules of skat or bridge, except for the extra rule that the first played of equal ranking cards has precedence.  The purpose of making a multiple lead is that provided that each member of the other team has at least one card of the suit led they cannot win by ruffing.  If the same cards were led singly it is more likely that some of them would be trumped.  A multiple lead may also win because a member of the other team, although void, does not have enough trumps to match the number of cards led.  None of these advantages apply to multiple trump leads, which although legal are very seldom used in practice.\n\nThe object of the play is to win tricks containing counting cards, that is kings, tens and fives.  Whenever the opponents win a trick containing any counting cards. these are extracted from the trick and placed face up in front of one of them.  All other cards played to tricks, including counting cards in tricks won by the declarers, are put face down in a single heap once the trick is complete.  Any counting cards among the six discarded by the dealer at the beginning of the hand are worth double (20 for Kings and tens, 10 for fives) and are won by the side which wins the last trick.\n\nScoring\nThe result of the hand depends on the number of card points won by the opponents. This determines which side scores how many points, and who will be the declarers for the next hand:\n\nOpponents\' card pointsScoreDeclarers for next handStarter for next hand\nZeroDeclarers score 2No changePrevious leader\'s partner\n5 to 35Declarers score 1No changePrevious leader\'s partner\n40 to 75No scoreOpponents become new declarersPlayer to previous leader\'s right\n80 to 95Opponents score 1Opponents become new declarersPlayer to previous leader\'s right\n100 or moreOpponents score 2Opponents become new declarersPlayer to previous leader\'s right\n\nExample\n\nCall the players N(orth), W(est), S(outh) and E(ast). At the start of the game both teams are on two, as already explained. Suppose South exposes a two during the deal, becoming the leader, and East-West take 15 points. Then N-S\'s score goes up to three, and North is the next starter. On this second hand three must be the trump rank (N-S\'s score). West exposes a three, and E-W take 40 points. The score is still three to N-S and two to E-W, but now E-W become the declarers with West as starter. The trump rank is now two (E-W\'s score). East exposes a 2 and N-S take no points at all. E-W now have a score of four. Four is the trump rank and East is the starter.\n\nAs explained above, the winning team are the first whose score goes above ace. Suppose N-S have a score of king and E-W are on queen. E-W are declarers but N-S take 90 points. The result is that N-S have a score of ace and become declarers, but they have not won the game yet - they need to score another point to win.\n\nVariations\nMany people play that after the deal the leader exposes the last six cards before adding them to his hand, but this version of the game is said to be less skilful.\nA complete game can last quite a long time - perhaps a couple of hours. If limited time is available it is possible to play a shortened game in which the winners are the side whose score first goes above seven, or any other agreed rank.  It is a pity to do this however, as the late hands played on ten, King and Ace have a special character because of the greater power of the high scoring cards.  Starting at seven might be a better idea.\nSome play that a game point is scored for each 20 card points (rather than 40). This can also shorten the game since it is possible to go up three (or occasionally even more than three) game points in one deal. The scoring in this version is as follows. (With a lot of points in the discard the opponents could in principle score more than 115 points by winning the last trick, in which case the table is extended in the obvious way.)\n\nOpponents\' card pointsScoreDeclarers for next handStarter for next hand\nZeroDeclarers score 3No changePrevious leader\'s partner\n5 to 15Declarers score 2No changePrevious leader\'s partner\n20 to 35Declarers score 1No changePrevious leader\'s partner\n40 to 55No scoreOpponents become new declarersPlayer to previous leader\'s right\n60 to 75Opponents score 1Opponents become new declarersPlayer to previous leader\'s right\n80 to 95Opponents score 2Opponents become new declarersPlayer to previous leader\'s right\n100 to 115Opponents score 3Opponents become new declarersPlayer to previous leader\'s right\n\nSome play that if the opponents win the last trick, the points in the discard, instead of being doubled, are multiplied by the number of cards played together by each player in the last trick. So if the last trick is an ordinary single trick won by the opponents, the points in the discard are not doubled, if it is a double trick they are doubled, if it is won with a three-card play they are trebled, and so on.\nSome play that if the opponents score 40 points exactly, the result is a draw, and in the next deal the first person who exposes a card with rank equal to his or her side\'s score becomes the leader, and this person\'s team are the declarers.\n"Yuan zhu" () (original trumps). Some play that twos are always trumps, no matter what the score is. If the trump rank is not two, the twos rank between the trump rank and the ace. For example with eights and diamonds trump, the trump suit from high to low is:\nred joker, black joker, 8, other 8\'s, 2, other 2\'s, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.\nShi Ji writes that the single deck game Sheng Ji is especially popular in northeastern China. To the south of the Yellow River and in Shanghai, they mostly play multiple deck versions such as Tuolaji (Tractor). In Shi Ji\'s home province Jilin, the following variations are played.\nThe game is usually played with original trumps (Yuan Zhu - see above).\nThe starter\'s team must win the last trick to win the hand and go up a level. If the opponents win the last trick, they automatically become the declarers, staying on the same level if they have fewer than 40 points. With the last trick and 40 points or more (counting only the points won in tricks, not the discarded cards) the opponents become declarers and go up a level. With 80 or more points and the last trick they would go up two levels. When the declarers win the last trick it is called Bao3 Di3 (); if the opponents win it, it is Kou1 Di3 ().\nIf a player has four cards of the same rank - for example all the 7\'s - they can be led together. If any other player who has four of a kind must play it, and the other players must play four trumps, or four cards including all their trumps if holding fewer than four trumps. The trick is won by the highest four of a kind played (trump rank highest, then twos if playing with Yuan Zhu, then other ranks in order): four trumps of unequal rank cannot win, even if they contain jokers. This powerful lead is called Dun1 (this is a Jilin dialect word, perhaps written as ). Some play that the points in a set of four Kings, Tens or Fives played in a Dun trick cannot be scored by the opponents - only scoring cards that are not part of a four of a kind are counted if the opponents win the trick.\nAt the end of the deal, the last 6 cards of the deck, which are known as Di3 Pai2 () are turned face up for all to see, and the six cards discarded by the starter are also shown face up. In a variation played in Changchun City, if the Di Pai contains no trumps apart from jokers, Yuan Zhu and cards of the trump rank, the starter is not allowed to pick up the Di Pai.\nWhen the trump rank is Jack, if the opponents win the last trick with a single Jack the declarers go back to the lowest level (3 if playing with Yuan Zhu or 2 if not), but remain the declarers for the next hand, for which the trump rank will be 3 if 2s are Yuan Zhu. This is called Gou1 (), meaning hook. The letter J on the Jack has the shape of a hook, and the declarers are hooked back to the lowest level.\nOther web pages\nHere is David Paxson\'s page on Forty Points, the Shanghai version of Bai Fen.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > King-Ten-Five group > Da Bai Fen\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1996, 2001, 2008, 2010.

A caller calls numbers chosen by drawing numbered balls or tokens  from a supply, or by an electronic randomiser. Players mark any numbers on their cards that are called, and the first player to mark a complete row wins a prize.\nIt is possible to play a similar game using standard playing-cards, and this page describes several ways to do this. \nBasic Game\nTwo standard 52-card packs without jokers are used. There can be up to ten players and a caller. The caller can be one of the players or do nothing but call cards, as preferred.\nFrom one pack of cards, five cards are dealt to each player, face up. (With eight or fewer players, six cards each can be dealt if preferred.) The caller draws cards one at a time from the other pack and calls out their rank and value - for example "five of diamonds". The holder (if any) of the called card turns it face down. The first player to turn all their cards face down wins. If playing for money, the winner\'s hand should be checked against the other pack to make sure all its cards have in fact been called.\nThis game is also known in some places as Bango! or Hoy! according to the word to be shouted by a player to announce that they have won.\nThirteen Card Bingo\nBy adding more packs of cards it is possible to play the above game with more players and larger hands. I have seen a version played in the Doncaster Whist Club in England by about 60 people. There were four players and a pack of cards at each table, and these were dealt out, thirteen to each player, as for Whist. As in the basic game, the caller calls cards from a separate pack, and the first player whose 13 cards are all called claims a prize.\nBingo without Suits\nThis is the same as the basic game, except that the caller calls only the rank of the card - "eight", "king", etc., suits being ignored. When a rank is called, players turn down all the cards they hold of that rank. In this version it is possible for two players to win simultaneously. Either they share the prize or you could play that the prize goes to whoever is first to claim a win.\nBingo with Payment for Uncalled Cards\nThis variant, played in Canada, is described by Cheryle Kaus on the Bingo page of her 52pickup.net site. Only one deck of cards is used and suits are ignored. The game is probably best for around 3 to 5 players. Before each deal, each player puts a stake into the pot. Five cards are then dealt face down to each player and ten face down to the middle of the table. Players look at their hands and if any player has four cards of the same rank, all the cards are shuffled and redealt.\nThe dealer turns the cards in the middle face up one at a time, and the players discard any cards they hold that match the rank of a face-up card in the middle. Players\' discards should be kept in front of them so that they can be checked. If the dealer turns up a card of a rank that has already appeared, further cards are turned up from the undealt portion of the deck until a card of a new rank is found (or until the deck runs out).\nA player who manages to discard all his or her cards shouts bingo and wins. All players then place one more stake in the pot for each card that they have not discarded, and the winner collects the pot.\nIf no one wins, the dealer  continues turning cards until ten different ranks have been turned up. Each player then pays one stake to the pot for each card they have not discarded, everyone adds another stake for the new deal, and the cards are shuffled and dealt again. Further hands are played until someone wins the pot.\nBingo with a Jackpot\nThis British variant, reported by Craig Crossland\nof Love to Play Bingo, is played with two 52-card packs without jokers, with a maximum of four players. Suits are ignored in this version.\nBefore each deal, each player contributes one stake to the main pot and two stakes to the jackpot. The two decks are shuffled together, and the dealer deals 6 cards face down to each player and 12 face down to the "jackpot pile". Cards are dealt one at a time to the players with two placed in the jackpot pile at the end of each rotation.\nThe dealer turns up cards from the jackpot pile one at a time and calls their ranks. Players discard all cards they hold that are equal in rank to the turned up card. Any player who manages to discard all his or her cards callds "bingo!" and collects the main pot and the jackpot.\nIf the jackpot pile is exhausted and no one has won, the dealer continues by turning up cards from the undealt portion of the pack and calling their ranks. As before, players discard any cards they hold that are equal to the turned card. A player who discards all his or her cards calls "bingo!" and collects the main pot only. The jackpot remains for the next deal and will have more money added to it.\nIf the whole pack runs out and no one has called bingo, there is no winner. Both pots are carried over to the next deal with further stake money added by all players.\nIf two or more players call "bingo!" on the same card, the money from the pot or pots they win is shared equally between them.\nBingo with Betting Rounds\nThe Wikipedia page on Card Bingo describes a game with poker-like betting rounds. One 52-card pack is used and suits are ignored. The players place an ante and five cards are dealt to each player and five face down to the table. The five table cards are turned face up one at a time, with a betting round before each is exposed. Players discard any cards equal to the turned up card. The first player to discard all five cards wins the pot. If no player achieves this after all five cards have been turned up, the winner is determined by adding up the values of remaining cards in players\' hands. Two to ten are face value. Players need to agree in advance:\n\nthe value of the jack, queen and king - could be 10, 10, 10 or 11, 12, 13;\nthe value of an ace - could be 1, 11 or 15;\nwhether the winner is the player with the highest total card values remaining or the lowest.\n\nHigh-Low Bingo\nThis variation is described on Cheryle Kaus\' Bingo page. It is similar to the betting game above, but played with two 52-card packs shuffled together and suitable for a larger number of players. A player who discards all five cards calls "bingo!" and wins the whole pot. If no one has declared "bingo!" after the five table cards have been turned up, the pot is split between the highest and lowest value hands, counting picture cards as 10 and aces as 1 for the low hand and 11 for high.\nIn Cheryle Kaus\' version, apparently it is the total value of all five of a player\'s cards that are counted, so players need to keep their discards in front of them.\nAlternatively, it would also be possible to play a similar high-low game in which the discarded cards were lost from the players\' hands and only the remaining cards were counted in the high-low competition for the pot.  \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Banking Games > Card Bingo\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2011.

Bo hung () means 'protect the emperor', and the game is also often known as dwng () meaning 'emperor'. In each deal two players, the emperor and his protector the eunuch (xiao baozi: ), play against a team of three, the farmers or people (ping min: ). The emperor and the eunuch are the holders of particular cards. While the emperor is known from the start, his protector remains hidden until the card is played.\nAs in all climbing games the object is to get rid of one's cards (and help one's partners to do so) by playing them singly or in combinations, where each play must beat the previous play.\nThe descriptions of this game that I have seen all emphasise that there are many variations, and I have partial descriptions of some of these. I would be grateful to hear from anyone who knows more about these or other versions of this game. The main account below describes a version played in Rizhao () in Shandong province. \nPlayers and cards\nThere are five players and a pack of 168 cards is used. This can be constructed from four standard 52-card packs from which the 3's, 4's and 5's are removed plus four red jokers and four black jokers. Suits are irrelevant in this game, and the cards rank from high to low:\nRed joker, Black joker, 2, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.\nOne red joker and one black joker are marked on the front, and the holders of these two cards will be the emperor and the eunuch respectively. Although standard Anglo-American cards can be used, the game is sufficiently popular that special 168-card packs can be obtained for this game with the emperor and eunuch cards ready printed.\nThe game may be played either clockwise or anticlockwise. Once established, the same direction of play is maintained throughout the session.\n\nDeal and Partnerships\nThe cards are shuffled and stacked face down. As in most Chinese games they are not distributed by a single player. Instead, players take their own cards from the top of the pile, one card at a time, in turn, until all the cards are taken. A neighbour of the play who shuffled cuts the cards, and the next player in that direction takes the first card. This establishes the direction of play. Since the number of cards is not exactly divisible by five, some players will have one more cards than others. Players hold their cards so that they can see their faces and their opponents cannot.\nFor subsequent deals, the turn to cut and to take the first card rotates in the direction of play, so the player who took the first card in the previous deal should cut, and the next player should take the first card.  \nHolding a hand of as many as 34 or 35 cards will be an unusual experience for most Western players. In China, players often hold their cards in more than one row or in a sort of array with equal cards in a column, as in the photographs.\n \nThe holder of the marked red joker (emperor card) is the emperor (or king) and the holder of the marked black joker is the emperor's protector (also known as the eunuch or the royalist), who plays as the emperor's partner. The other three players are the common people, also known as farmers or revolutionaries. The holder of the emperor card  can choose not to be the emperor: in this case the emperor card is passed to the next player in the direction of play. No card is given in exchange: the original holder of the emperor card now has one card fewer and the new emperor one card more than were originally dealt. If the new emperor does not want the role, he or she can pass the card again, and this continues until it is received by someone who is willing to be the emperor.\nWhile the emperor is immediately known from the fact that this player begins the play, the emperor's partner should keep quiet. The common people will not know initially which player is supporting the emperor: they may suspect who it is during the play by observing who seems to be helping the emperor, but it will only be known for certain when the marked black joker is played.\nIf one player holds both the emperor and the eunuch cards, this player will play alone against a team of four, although the team members will not initially realise that this is the situation. If the emperor does not wish to play alone, this can be avoided by passing the emperor card to the left.\nIn the second and subsequent deals there is a penalty for the losers of the previous deal. After all the cards have been taken,  the members of the team that lost the previous deal must each give away their highest card other than a joker: this will usually be a two. These high cards are placed on the table face down, taken by the members of the winning team and added to their hands. The emperor from the previous deal must give away his or her highest two cards (other than jokers) if the emperor's team lost, and takes two of the high cards offered by the farmers if the emperor's team won. An emperor who was playing alone will give or receive four cards in the next deal.\nPlayable Combinations\nCards can be played singly or several at a time. When playing more than one card, the cards must form a playable combination. The playable combinations are:\n\nAny quantity of equal cards, irrespective of suit, for example 8-8 or Q-Q-Q-Q or 9-9-9-9-9-9-9.\nAny number of equal cards together with any number of jokers of any colour, for example 7-7-black or 6-red or K-K-K-black-red. A combination including one joker is known as gu le y ge (: one card hanging), with two jokers gu le ling ge (: a pair of cards hanging), with three jokers  and so on.\nAny number of jokers of any colour, for example black-black-red.\n\nA single card can only be beaten by a higher single card. A combination beats a previously played combination if and only if\n\nit is playable, and\nit has the same number of cards, and\neach card of the new combination beats a corresponding card of the previous combination.\n\nSo for example: \n\n7-7-7 can be beaten by 10-10-10, which can be beaten by A-A-A, which can be beaten by 2-2-2, (two being higher than ace in this game), which can only be beaten by three jokers;\n8-8-8-8 can be beaten by 9-9-9-black, which can be beaten by Q-Q-Q-red, but 8-8-8-black does not beat 8-8-8-8 in this version of the game (but see variations);\nany combination containing a red joker is unbeatable;\na combination containing black jokers can only be beaten by a higher combination containing at least as many red jokers - for example 7-7-black-black can be beaten by 9-9-red-red or by K-black-red-red, but not by Q-black-black-red (since only one of the black jokers in the first combination has been beaten) and not by 7-7-red-red (since 7 does not beat 7).\n\nPlay\nThe emperor begins by leading any single card or playable combination. All players, in anticlockwise order, may either pass - saying 'byo' () or 'gu' () - or beat it by playing a higher card or combination. As explained above, each play must consist of the same number of cards, and must be higher than the previous play. This continues for as many circuits as necessary until no one is able and willing to beat the last card or combination that was played. When a play is followed by consecutive passes from all the other players, the player who played the last (unbeaten) combination begins again and is free to play any card or playable combination.\n    \nNote that passing does not prevent a player from playing at his or her next turn if someone else has played meanwhile. \nA player whose play is currently unbeaten may ask the other players not to beat it, saying 'zhn pi' (). If the teams are not yet known this may provide a clue as to which side the player is on or may be deceptive. The other players do not have to comply.\nAs players run out of cards they drop out of the play and the others continue until all members of one or the other team have played all their cards. If someone plays their last card(s) and these are not beaten, the turn to restart the play with any card or playable combination passes to the next player to the right who still has cards.\nResult \nIf the first and last players to run out of cards are from opposing teams, the first player's team wins and the last player's team loses.\nIf the emperor has a partner, and the first and last players are from the same team, the game is a tie.\nIf the emperor is alone, the emperor wins if he is first to run out of cards and loses otherwise.\nAs mentioned above, in the next deal members of the losing team have to give away their best cards other than twos to the winners. If there is a tie, in the next deal everyone keeps the cards they were dealt.\nSixes Played Last\nBao Huang is sometimes played with the extra rule that sixes (the lowest cards) must be played last. In this version it is illegal to play a six until one's hand contains nothing but sixes. \nThe play in this variant is somewhat more challenging. In order to be first out of cards, it is necessary to keep a winning combination for your second to last play, so as to finish by leading all your sixes. If your second to last play is beaten, you are doomed to come last unless the player before you ends with an unbeaten set of sixes, allowing you to lead your sixes next.\nOther Variations\nLeo Hong has provided partial information about some variations played in Shanghai and elsewhere. I would like to hear from anyone who can explain these and other variants in more detail, or who is in a position to translate and interpret the Chinese pages with rules of this game, such as those listed below.\nAlternative scoring system\nThere is a scoring system which gives +4 points to the first player who runs out of cards, +2 to the second, 0 to the third, -2 to the fourth and -4 to the fifth. Each team adds up the points scored by its members, and that score is applied to everyone in the team.  For example if the emperor's team come first and second, both will score  +6 (4+2), and the three members of the other team each score -6 (0-2-4). If the emperor's team come first and fourth, they each gain  2 points (+4-2),  and their opponents lose 2 each. If the emperor's team come third and fifth, they each lose 4,  and the opponents each gain 4. Note that because of the unequal size of the teams, the positive and negative points do not balance in this system. To make them balance the emperor's score would need to be doubled.\nIf the emperor plays alone, the  emperor's score is doubled. This presumably means that, for example, the emperor would score 8 points for coming first alone and the other players would lose  4 points each. (To balance the scores, the emperor's score would need to be doubled again, to 16.)\nPassing of Cards\nUsing the scoring system above, a draw is possible if the emperor's team finishes first and last or second and fourth. In this case, no cards are passed after the following deal.\nSome play that the losing team place their highest cards (other than jokers) face up on the table, and these are taken by the winning team in order of their finishing position in the previous deal. \nAnnouncement of partnerships\nSome play that the emperor's partner may announce who he is at the start of the play, and the scores are then doubled. \nAlso  the emperor, if also holding the marked black joker, may announce that he has no partner, and  the scores are tripled instead of doubled. \nOrder of Playable Combinations    \nSome play that in a combination with jokers, it is only the jokers that have to beat the corresponding cards of the previous play. It is sufficient for the ordinary cards to be equal. With this rule, 9-9-9-9 can be beaten by 9-9-9-black, which can be beaten by 9-9-9-red. However, if I have understood this version correctly, 9-9-black-black does not beat 9-9-9-black even though it has more jokers. Each joker has to be beaten, not just equalled, so a combination including a red joker is still unbeatable. Also, a set of ordinary cards can only be beaten by another set of the same rank if a joker is used: if the previous player played 8-8-8 it is not possible for another 8-8-8 to be played on it: the next player would have to be at least 9-9-9 or 8-8-black.\nLeo Hong's description says that equal cards can be played 'with or without trumps', and that 'trumps like joker or card 2 could make a hand by themselves if necessary'. Taken together, these statements might imply that twos as well as jokers are considered 'trumps', and can therefore be combined with other cards to make combinations like 7-7-7-2. However none of his examples feature this kind of combination so probably this is not allowed.\nOther Bao Huang websites\nThe Chinese website  has some information about Bao Huang and its variants.\nAnother set of rules in Chinese can be found at homygame.com.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Climbing games > Bao Huang\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2013, 2014.

It uses a standard 52-card pack as for bridge or poker, ranking as usual from highest to lowest A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 in each of the four suits.  In the course of a session, each player will play each of the seven contracts once, so that there are 28 hands played in all.\n\nThe initial declarer is chosen at random.  For the first seven hands, this player will be declarer.  The cards will be dealt by the player on declarer\'s right, and cut by the player opposite to declarer. After this declarer has done her seven contracts, the player on the original declarer\'s left will be declarer for seven contracts, and so on, until everyone has done her seven contracts.\nIn each of these contracts, each player is playing for herself.  Declarer chooses the contract, but there is no reason for the other players to cooperate against her.  The rules about doubling, however, are asymmetrical with respect to declarer (see below).\nThe word "barbu" is French for "bearded". In some packs, the king of hearts is shown with a beard, and the contract in which the object is to avoid taking this card is also sometimes known as "barbu". The game Barbu has existed in France for some time in a simple form where the different games are just played in a fixed sequence (no choice of contract and no doubling). The more elaborate modern version described here was developed by bridge players and was a favourite of the Italian "Blue Club" bridge team. \nThe Seven Contracts\nThere are five "negative" and two "positive" contracts.  \nIn negative contracts, there are no trumps. The declarer leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible - a player who cannot follow suit may discard any card. The winner of a trick leads to the next. In certain contracts there are restrictions on what card may be led to a trick. The negative contracts are:\n\nNo Tricks (Losing). Each trick scores -2 points to the player winning it.  The total score for the contract is therefore -26.\nNo Queens.  Each queen scores -6 points to the player winning it in a trick. The total score for the contract is therefore -24. After a queen is played, it is kept face up in front of the player who won the trick, so that everyone can see which queens have been taken by whom. When the fourth queen is played, the play ends at the end of that trick, as there are no more points at stake on that hand.\nNo Last Two. The last-but-one trick scores -10 to the player winning it, and the last trick scores -20 to the player winning it.  The total score for the contract is therefore -30.\nNo Hearts. Each heart scores -2 points to the player winning it in a trick, except for the ace of hearts, which scores -6.  The total score for the contract is therefore -30.  It is forbidden for a player to lead hearts unless she has nothing but hearts in her hand. Hearts won in tricks are kept face up in front of the winner of the trick until the end of the play, so that everyone can see who has taken which hearts.\nNo King of Hearts (Barbu). The king of hearts scores -20 to the player winning it in a trick.  The total score for the contract is therefore -20.  It is forbidden for a player to lead hearts unless she has nothing but hearts in her hand.\n\n\n\nThe positive contracts are:\n\n\nTrumps.  Declarer chooses a trump suit.  The declarer leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible. A trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if it contains no trump, by the highest card of the suit led. A player who can legally head a trick by playing a trump is obliged to do so.  (This means that if trumps are led, players are obliged not only to follow suit with a trump, but to play a higher trump than any so far in the trick if this is possible.  It also means that if a side-suit is led, a player who is void in that side-suit is obliged to head the trick with a trump unless it already contains a trump higher than any in her hand, in which case she can play anything.) The winner of a trick leads to the next. Each trick scores +5 points to the player winning it.  The total score for the contract is therefore +65.\nDominoes (Fantan).  Declarer chooses a starting rank. For example if the starting rank is to be 5, she says "dominoes from the five". The object is to get rid of all one\'s cards before the other players. Each player in turn, starting as usual with declarer, must, if possible, play an acceptable card face upwards to the table.  Acceptable cards are those of the chosen rank, also cards of the same suit and adjacent rank to one already played. Note that every suit must be started with the rank chosen by the declarer - for example in dominoes from the 5, the holder of 7 cannot play it until 5 and 6 are in place, even if 4-56-7 have already been played.  A player who cannot play, having no acceptable card, indicates this (perhaps by rapping on the table) and the turn to play passes on. In particular, declarer may have no cards of the rank she chooses, in which case she begins the play by passing. The played cards form a layout with the four cards of the starting rank in a column in the centre, and the other cards of their suits built up in sequence on either side. Play continues until all four players have played all their cards. As usual, aces are high and twos low, so the last card played will be either an ace or a two. \nExample: A chooses dominoes from the nine and plays the 9 of hearts, B plays the 9 of spades, C plays the 10 of spades. Playable cards for D are now H8, H10, S8, SJ, D9, C9. If D has none of these she must pass.\nThe first player to go out scores +45. Play continues between the other three players, and the second scores +20. The last two players continue playing and the third to go out scores +5 and the last scores -5.  The total score for the contract is therefore +65.   This contract is sometimes known as Fantan.\n\n\nThe scores are cunningly chosen so that the total over seven hands is 0.\n\nDoubling\n\nAfter the contract has been chosen (including announcement of the trump suit in Trumps and the starting rank in Dominoes / Fantan), each player in turn, starting on declarer\'s left, has one opportunity to double.  A player may double all, some, or none of the other players.  Declarer, however, is restricted in that she may only double players who have doubled her.\n\nIn each series of seven hands, each player is obliged to double declarer at least twice.\n\nIn the two positive contracts, the other players may only double declarer, not each other.  Declarer may double those who have doubled her, as usual.\n\nWhen doubling a player who has already doubled you, it is conventional to use the word "redouble".  When making every possible double and redouble, it is conventional to use the word "maximum".\n\nA double is, in effect, a side-bet between the two players involved about which of them will do better than the other.  When you are deciding whether to double another player, the only issue is whether you expect to score better than her.\n\nScoring\n\nThe doubles are recorded on the score sheet as they are made.  Doubles of declarer are ringed, to make it easier to ensure that each player makes her compulsory two doubles of declarer.\n\nAt the end of a hand, it is scored.  First of all, the points won or lost by the players are written down.  Then the effects of the doubles are calculated pair by pair, for each of the six pairs of players:\n\nIf neither of two players has doubled the other, there is no side-payment.\nIf only one of a pair of players has doubled the other, the difference between their raw scores is calculated, and this difference is added on to the score of the one who did better and subtracted from the score of the one who did worse.\nIf each of a pair of players has doubled the other, the difference between their raw scores is calculated and doubled, and this difference is added on to the score of the one who did better and subtracted from the score of the one who did worse.\n\n\nFor example, here is a score-sheet, with two hands already played and scored.\n\n\nOn the first hand, Anne was declarer and chose No Queens.  Her choice of contract was written "Q" in the left column.  \n\nBeth (with a good hand for No Queens) began the doubling by saying "maximum" to double everyone else.  This was recorded in Beth\'s column as a letter "X";  and was ringed to indicate that it includes a double of declarer.  Then Cath doubled Anne and no-one else (she believes that the outcome of No Queens is unpredictable, so she might as well make a double of declarer).  This was recorded as a letter "A" for Anne, with a ring round it as Anne is declarer.  Then Diana passed (having a poor hand).  Then Anne redoubled Cath (but not Beth, who seems from her behaviour to have a strong hand).  This was recorded as a letter "C" for Cath.\n\nIn the play, Diana captured two queens among her tricks, and Anne and Cath captured one each.  This was recorded as -6 to Anne, -6 to Cath, and -12 to Diana.\n\nThen the side-payments were calculated.  These are shown here in color, for the sake of this explanation (normally, of course, they would all be written with the same pencil).\n\nA/B.  Beth has doubled Anne, but Anne has not doubled Beth.  So there is one double between them.  Anne scored -6 while Beth scored 0, So Anne pays 6 to Beth.  This is shown in red.\nA/C.  Anne and Cath have doubled each other, so there is a double side-payment between them.  However they both made the same score of -6, so there is no side-payment.\nA/D.  Neither Anne nor Diana has doubled the other, so there is no side-payment.\nB/C.  There is one double between them, and the score difference is 6, so Cath pays 6 to Beth.  This is shown in green.\nB/D.  There is one double between them, and the score difference is 12, so Diana pays 12 to Beth.  This is shown in blue.\nC/D.  There are no doubles between them, so there is no side-payment.\n\n\nThen the totals were calculated, and written into the totals column for each player.\n\nFinally, the total value of the contract was written into the check-sum column at the right, and a check made that the total of the four players and the rightmost column added up to 0.\n\nOn the second hand, Anne chose No Hearts.  Beth and Cath passed, Diana said Maximum, and Anne redoubled Diana.  Anne took no hearts, Beth took 6 points worth, Cath took 20 points worth, and Diana took 4 points worth.  The side-payments were calculated and added up as described, and the check-sum was checked.  Note that the five figures in the right column for each player and for the check-sum are running totals.\n\nAndy Christensen has provided a preprinted score sheet.\nAdvice on Skilful Play\n\nNo Hearts and No King of Hearts are generally best bid on hands with many hearts.  This is because the rules forbid the leading of hearts.  A hand with long hearts will be short in the other suits, and will thus get more opportunities to discard.\n\nIn No King of Hearts, a player who holds the King, and is confident of not taking it herself, will be influenced by the doubling on where she dumps it.  It can therefore be possible for a player with a very poor hand, who did not double, to cooperate with declarer in dumping the King on a player who did double.  (This assumes that declarer holds the King.)  One way of cooperating with declarer is by returning the suits which she leads.\n\nTo bid No Last Two, aces can be as valuable as twos.  A very poor holding is 9 8 7 6:  you can be confident that the other players will not lead this suit for you.\n\nThe total score for No Tricks is 30, but this is in effect the smallest contract, as the tricks tend to be spread around.  It is therefore a suitable hand to keep to last, as playing it with an unsuitable hand is rarely a total disaster.  In playing No Tricks, ingenious sacrifice plays (such as are skilful in ramsch and other negative games) are not appropriate.  It is better to keep your head down and avoid each trick as it comes round.\n\nNo King of Hearts only scores 20, but is really a big hand.  This is because the penalty of 20 all comes in one lump.\n\nTrumps can sensibly be left to the last hand, as you can be sure of being dealt a hand with at least four trumps in it.  Do not bid Trumps for the first hand of your seven unless you expect to win at least seven tricks.  From a trump holding of e.g. A J 10 9  6 5 3 the lead of the jack can be effective:  there is a good chance that this will force the play of both the queen and the king, because of the trump-overtaking rule.\n\nIn dominoes, aces and twos are liabilities.  A "block" like 765 can be powerful, in a suit in which the 4 3 and 2 are not held.  Holding the specified rank is not necessarily a good thing:  with an ideal hand such as 568, 5689, 689, 689 the best choice of rank is the 7.\n\nOver seven hands, declarer can expect the best score, closely followed by the player on her right.  The player on declarer\'s left can expect the poorest score, as she must make her doubles before hearing those of the other players.\n\nIt is bad to leave a compulsory double to the last hand of a seven, unless this hand will be something small (No Tricks, or maybe No Queens).  It is particularly bad to be obliged to double a positive contract.\n\nIn view of the advice in the previous paragraph...  Suppose it is the sixth hand of the seven.  Declarer chooses No Tricks, leaving Trumps for last.  A player doubles declarer only.  Declarer should recognise that this is a desperation double, and redouble it (if it really came from a good hand, the doubler would have doubled the other players as well).\n\nIf you have a hand which is very good for several contracts, it is best to choose one which will induce some doubles.  For example, consider a hand which can guarantee taking no tricks, and has a heart void.  If you bid No Last Two, say, probably no-one will double you.  But if you bid No Hearts, you will likely get a double from an opponent:  at least one of them must hold at least five hearts, which is normally a strong holding in this contract.\n\nVariations\nDeal, Declaration and Lead\nSome play that it is the dealer that chooses the contract. The first lead is still made by the player to the left of the dealer (so that the dealer plays last to the first trick), except in dominoes, in which the dealer starts.\nDoubles and Redoubles\n\nSome people only allow players to double declarer, not each other, and if the declarer redoubles, she must redouble everyone who doubled, not just some of them.\n\nNo King of Hearts (Barbu) and No Queens\nSome do not prohibit heart leads in Barbu.\nSome require players to play the King of Hearts and Queens in these contracts at the earliest safe opportunity. Thus you are not allowed to save your penalty card to give to a particular opponent, which protects players from being victimised but also reduces the tactical possibilities.\nTrumps\nSome do not require players void of the suit led to trump (or overtrump) in this game. A player who has no card of the suit led can play any card.\nFantan (Dominoes)\nMany people play Fantan with the Ace low, so that each suit ends with the King at one end and the Ace at the other.\n\nSome play that the first card played by the declarer determines the starting rank. This means that doubles are announced before the start rank is known, and that the declarer cannot choose a rank that she does not have.\nDonald B. Lagosz-Sinclair suggests reducing the Fantan scores to 30 / 20 / 10 / 0 (with barbu valued at -15) since otherwise they have a disproportionate effect on the result.\nExtra contract - Ravage City\n\nNo trumps. Rules of play as for other negative contracts. Whichever player takes the most cards in any one suit scores -36. If there is a tie between two players (probably each has most cards in a different suit), each scores -18; if three players tie each scores -12; if all four tie, all get -9. Some play Ravage City with a lower score -24 (-12 for a two-way tie, -8 for a three-way tie, -6 for a four-way ties).\n\nIf you play with Ravage City there will obviously be 32 deals - 8 for each declarer - rather than 28. The scoring schedule for the other contracts will need adjusting to preserve the zero sum feature.\n\nScoring\n There are a number of different scoring schemes possible. One common one is to score -15 for taking the King of Hearts in "No King of Hearts" and +40/+20/+10/-10 for dominoes. \n\nSome schemes lose the zero sum of the scores, which is a pity as a zero sum is very useful for checking, and makes it easier to convert the result to money won or lost. For example Mark Brader contributed the following scoring system:   Barbu: -25 for the heart king;\nFantan: first out +40, second out +20, third out 0, fourth out -20; \nNo Hearts: -12 for the ace, -4  each other heart; No last two: -10, -20;\nLosing tricks: -5 per trick; No\nQueens: -15 per queen; \nRavage city: -36 divided between losers,\nTrumps: +5 per trick. The total is -684.\nAny scheme can easily be made zero sum without affecting the balance of the game by adjusting all four scores in Dominoes (Fantan) by the same amount (in fact you might have to change some by 1 more than others due to rounding effects).\n Here is a description of Barbu [zipped MSWord file] contributed by David Smith of Cambridge, MA, USA - it has slightly different scoring from the description on this page, and includes further material on strategy.\n  \nThree-Player Barbu\nNoel Leaver, Don Lagosz-Sinclair, Mark Brader and David Smith have contributed versions of Barbu for three players.\nBarbette\nWarren Chang has developed Barbette, a shortened version of Barbu that takes only 16 deals rather than 28 or 32.\nBuckhaven High School version\nBarbu is often played in France with only 32 cards. The version formerly played at Buckhaven High School, Fife, Scotland is a development of this form, with several additional features. Scott Geissler \n<!--\n    pmad(\'ascottgeisasler\',\'etisecali.eco.uke\');\n// -->\n\nhas contributed his rule book for Buckhaven High School Barbu in the form of a Microsoft Word Document.\nOther Barbu Web Pages\n\nJeff Goldsmith\'s San Francisco Barbu page includes a number of variations and alternative scoring schedules. He has also published a strategy guide. \nHere are Ethan Bradford\'s Yale Barbu rules and a scoring spreadsheet for this variant, which automatically calculates scores from input of the game, doubles and number of penalty cards etc. taken.\nHere is an archive copy of Tom Carmichael\'s Barbu Page which gave rules in English.\n\nJean-Franois Bustarret has a Barbu page with rules in French. The game is for 3 to 5 players and the scoring and set of contracts is somewhat different. The points are negative and the scores are:\n\nNo tricks: 5 points per trick\nNo hearts: 5 points per heart\nNo queens: 20 points per queen\nBarbu (no king of hearts): 80 points\nSalad: all the above penalties count at once\nTricks: -5 points per trick\nNo first or last trick: 40 points for the first; 40 points for the last\nDomino: -50/-25/0/25/50 (5 players), -50/-20/20/40 (4 players), -40/0/40 (3 players)\n\nThere is no doubling. There is also a version given in which only the first five contracts are played, in a fixed sequence.\n\nBarbu software and on line games\n\nShireen Mohandes and Andy Bowles run an Online Barbu page with rules, bidding competitions, online games and tournaments and a ladder.\n  From the Tams11 lobby you can obtain an Windows Barbu game that can be played on line against live opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Compendium Games > Barbu\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1995, 2006, 2010.

It is popular in the province of New Brunswick, on the Atlantic coast of Canada. It is said to be a French Acadian game. In French it sometimes known  as Deux Cents (200) and sometimes as Dix or Bidder 10 (Tens). Versions played in Quebec are also known as Le Rough or Le Ruff  and around the eastern townships La Bloutte or La Fouine. There are some players in neighbouring Maine, USA, for example in Fort Kent, where the game is called La Bloute, and I have received two reports  from as far away as Alberta where it is called Tens or Barouche. The only book descriptions of versions of this game that I have been able to find are in Culbertson\'s Hoyle (1950) under the name \'Chinese Bridge (four-hand)\', and in French under the name \'Le Ruff\' in Richard Raymond\'s Rgles des Jeux de Cartes st des Patiences (2nd ed 2006) credited to Marie-Anna Bois of Quebec.\nThe age and origins of 200 are uncertain, but it is likely to have originated in Canada. It is best known in New Brunswick, where several correspondents say that it has been played for at least 3 or 4 generations, so clearly it was already known there in the 1930\'s or earlier. It is closely related to Rook, a game with special cards played in the Midwest USA and Canada. It seems likely either that Rook, which was first published by Parker Brothers in 1906, was  based on 200, or that the games had a common ancestor. 200 also has some similarity to a group of Chinese games known as Sheng Ji of which 100 is a typical example. However, it is hard to establish a convincing historical connection with the Chinese games, and the resemblance may be coincidental.\nThere are many variations. I will first describe what seems to be the standard form for four players in partnerships using 36 cards and playing to a target score of 200 (after which the game is named). Less serious players very often use 40 cards and play with a 4-card kitty. In the northern part of New Brunswick, the target score is often raised to 300 or 500 for a longer game. There are also versions for 2, 5 and 6 players.\nPlayers and Cards\n200 is generally agreed to be best for four players in partnerships - North and South play against East and West. In the variations section, versions for six, five and two players are described.\nFor the 4-player game without a kitty, a 36-card pack is created by removing all the 2\'s, 3\'s, 4\'s, 6\'s from a standard 52-card pack without jokers. The cards in each suit rank from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-5.\nWhen playing with a kitty, or with more than 4 players, more additional cards may be used - see variations.\nIn all forms of the game, the cards have point values as follows:\n\n\neach ace: 10 points   \n each ten: 10 points\n each five: 5 points\n other cards: 0 points\n\n\nso that there are 100 card points in the deck altogether.\nThe dealing, bidding and play are all clockwise.\nDeal\nThe first dealer is chosen at random. For example, a player can shuffle the deck and deal single cards face up to the players starting with the player on the left. The first player who receives a jack is the first dealer. After each hand, the turn to deal passes to the left. Before each deal, the cards are shuffled by the dealer and cut by the opponent to dealer\'s right. The dealer then deals 9 cards face down to each player, in batches of three, starting with the player to dealer\'s left.\nBidding\nPlayers now bid for the right to choose which suit will be trumps, each bid representing the number of points the bidder\'s partnership contracts to take in tricks if not outbid.\nThe player to the left of the dealer speaks first, and the bidding continues clockwise. The minimum bid is 50, all bids must be multiples of 5, and each bid must be higher than the last. A player who does not wish to bid can pass, but having passed cannot bid again in that auction.\nIf all four players pass, the hands are thrown in without score and the next dealer deals. If there is a bid, the bidding continues for as many circuits as necessary until three players have passed, or until somone bids 100, the highest possible bid.\nThe final (and highest) bidder becomes the contractor, and announces which suit will be trump for that hand.\nNote: it is not necessary for the first bidder to begin at the minimum 50 - the initial bid can be as high as you like.\nPlay\nHaving announced the trump suit, the contractor leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if able to. A player who has no card of the suit led is free to play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or, if it contains no trumps, by the highest card of the suit that was led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nThe objective is to win tricks that contain card points (Aces, 10\'s and 5\'s). Tricks without points have no value.\nIf the contractor fails to announce a trump suit before leading to the first trick, the suit of the first card played by the contractor automatically becomes trump.\nPlaying a trump when you have no card of the non-trump suit that was led is known as "cutting", no doubt from the French "couper", which means to trump in a card game, but also literally "to cut". There is no obligation to try to win the trick or to cut when you are unable to follow suit - it is legal to discard from another suit. Indeed if you expect your partner to win the trick you will probably want to discard a ten or five that might otherwise have been lost to the opponents.\nCompleted tricks are stored face down in front of a member of the team that won them and may not be looked at again by anyone until the end of the play.\nScoring\nScores are kept on paper. Each team begins with a score of zero.\nWhen all the cards have been played, each team counts the value of the point cards in their tricks. If the contractor\'s team has at least as many card points as the final bid, the total value of the cards in their tricks is added to their cumulative score. If the number of card points they took is less than the bid, the amount of the bid is subtracted from their cumulative score.\nThe opposing team add whatever card points they took in tricks to their cumulative score, with one exception: if the contractor\'s opponents currently have a cumulative score of 100 or more, then they can score for points in their tricks only if at least one member of their team bid during the auction. If they both passed at their first opportunity to speak, they score nothing for the points in their tricks.\nExample: Scores are NS:120, EW:100. NS bid 75.\n\nIf NS take 85 card points, their new score is 205 and they win the game.\nIf NS take 75 card points, their new score is 195. If East or West bid they score their 25 points for a cumulative score of 125; if they both just passed their score stays at 100.\nIf NS take 70 card points they lose the 75 they bid and their score is now 45. EW can score their 30 points provided that one of them bid for a total of 130; if both just passed their score stays at 100.\n\nA team\'s cumulative score can be negative. On the score sheet this is usually shown by drawing a box around the number - for example minus 95 is written as 95. The team is said to be "in the box", or sometimes "in the hole" (shown by a circle rather than a box around the score). Failing in a contract is sometimes known as being "boxed".\nThe first team to achieve a score of 200 points or more wins the game. If both teams reach 200 or more on the same deal then the bidding team wins.\nThe game also ends if one team reaches a negative score of 200 or worse while the other team\'s score is positive or zero. In that case the team with minus 200 or worse loses the game.\nVariations\nMany of these variations are extremely widespread, although some experts dislike those that increase the luck element of the game. Most informal games are played with a kitty and with the 100 for 200 bid. Allowing the dealer to keep the bid is also very common.\n200 with a Kitty\nProbably most non-tournament games of 200 are played with a kitty. The kitty is a face down packet of four cards that can be used by the contractor to improve his or her hand. This introduces an element of uncertainty and tends to lead to higher bids.\nIn this variant, a 40-card pack is used, including the sixes. Cards in each suit rank from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5. Nine cards are dealt to each player and four face card down to a central "kitty". The usual method of dealing is: a batch of three cards to each player; two to the kitty; three to each player; two to the kitty; three to each player.\nAfter the usual bidding process, the high bidder takes the four kitty cards without showing them and discards four cards face down in exchange before naming trumps. The cards discarded can include some or all of the cards obtained from the kitty. No one is allowed to look at these discarded cards until the end of the play - even the contractor cannot look at them after the first card has been led. The play the proceeds as usual, and any points in the discarded cards count for the contractor\'s opponents at the end of the play. Scoring is as usual.\nThere are several variations concerning the contractor\'s four-card discard and how it is counted.\n\nThe most usual rule, as given above, is that any cards can be discarded, no one can look at the discard, and that any points in it count to the contractor\'s opponents.\nSome play that any trumps that are discarded must be shown to the other players after trumps are announced and before the play begins.\nSome play that any points in the discard count for the side that wins the last trick.\nA few players award the points in the discard to the side that wins the first trick, but the discard still cannot be looked at until the end of the play.\nSome players do not allow any point cards (aces, tens or fives) to be discarded. This could rarely lead to an impossible situation if the contractor had 10 or more of the 12 point cards among the 13 cards held after picking up the kitty.\nSome players do not allow trumps or point cards to be discarded. There is a greater chance of this leading to an impossible situation, since there are now 19 cards that cannot be discarded, and it is quite conceivable that the contractor could hold 10 of these.\nSome players require the contractor to inform the other players if there are any point cards in the discard.\nSome count the discarded points for the contractor. This changes the tactics, allowing the contractor to save tens and fives simply by discarding them. Naturally this leads to higher bids.\n\n100 for 200\nThis bid, known as "cent pour deux cents" in French, or sometimes as "two for one", is allowed in most informal games. It is the highest bid, and commits the contractor\'s team to win all 100 points in tricks. They score 200 points if successful, thus winning the game unless they were in the hole (box) when they bid it. If a bid of 100 for 200 fails, the contractor\'s team loses just 100 points (and as usual the opponents score the points they make provided that either they have bid or their score is below 100).\n100 to win the game\nSome play that if the bidders take 100 points in their tricks, they win the whole game, irrespective of the bid or the previous scores. This is known as a bloutte, and gives its name to this version of the game. If a team takes 100 card points while losing one zero-point trick, this is known as a chienne (bitch), and winning 100 points while losing two empty tricks is a double chienne. The result is the same, but a chienne or double chienne is considered more embarassing for the losers.\nKeeping\nIn this widespread variation, the dealer is allowed to equal the highest bid so far, rather than bidding higher. The dealer would say "I keep the bid". Example: North deals, East passes, South bids 60, West bids 75, North "keeps" 75, East cannot bid, having already passed, South passes. If West passes now, North is the contractor and the bid is 75. Alternatively West might bid 80, and North would then have the option of "keeping" 80 or passing, and so on.\nWhen keeping is allowed, a bid of 100 (or 100 for 200) by a player other than the dealer does not automatically end the auction. The dealer still has the right to keep the 100 bid.\nOne correspondent describes an unusual variation of this where any player can keep (not just the dealer), but you cannot keep a bid that has already been kept. So the bidding might start: East "50", South "keep 50", West "55", North "keep 55", East "60", South "65", West "pass", North "pass", East "keep 65" and so on. West cannot keep 50 in the first round of bidding since 50 has already been kept by South; similarly East cannot keep 55.\nDealer must bid after three passes\nMany people do not allow all four players to pass. If the first three players pass the dealer is forced to become the contractor and bid 50. This rule is commonly found in 200 with a kitty, where after three passes, with the help of the kitty the dealer has good chances of success.\nSingle Round Bidding\nIn some groups each player only gets one chance to bid, the dealer speaking last. Those who play this variation usually allow the dealer to keep.\nWith single round bidding, some play that when the first three players pass, the declarer simply becomes the contractor, with the right to use the kitty if any and name trump, without bidding. In this case the contractor\'s team cannot lose points, though the opponents might score more than them. If the first two players pass, then in this variation the third player should bid if at all possible, to stop the dealer getting the contract for nothing.\nDenis Landry reports that in some parts of Qubec (near the Eastern Townships), the game is played under the name "Bloutte" (spelling uncertain) with single round bidding and a target score of 100 to win the game.\nTarget score of 300 or 500\nIn the northern part of New Brunswick, it is normal to play to a target score of 300 or 500 points to win the game, rather than 200.\nIn this case, the threshhold beyond which you are "required to bid" in order to score points against the contractor is set at 100 points below the target. The idea is that it should not be possible to win a game on a hand where your team did not bid in the auction.\n\nWhen the target is 300 points, you can score points without having bid only if your score at the start of the hand is 195 or less.\nWhen the target is 500 points, you can score points without having bid only if your score at the start of the hand is 395 or less.\n\nSome players require a team to have bid at least 60 to qualify for points when they are at or above the "required to bid" threshhold. A bid of just 50 or 55 does not qualify.\nThe amount you have to be "in the hole" (or box) to lose (provided that the other team is not also in the hole) is normally set equal to the target. For example with a target of 500, if one team goes 500 points \'in the hole\', the other team wins, if their score is 0 or higher.\nSome play that you need 500 to win the game, but you lose if you are 300 in the hole. No doubt there are many other local variations on these target numbers.\nOther scoring variations\nSome play that if both teams reach the target score on the same deal, the team with the higher score wins - not the bidding team. It\'s unclear what happens in this version if the scores are equal - for example 210:210. Perhaps another deal is played to decide the winners.\nSome play that the game can only be won by winning a bid. So if a hand results in the contractor\'s opponents reaching 200 or more while the contractor\'s team is still below 200 after adding the score for their successful bid, the game is not over - further hands must be played. The game ends only when a contractor\'s bid is successful AND after scoring the contractor\'s team have a cumulative score of 200 or more.\nSome play that if a team wins while the other team is in the hole (below zero), this is considered a skunk - equivalent to winning two games. Others use the term skunk for the case where the losers neither won nor lost any points, so the game is won in two deals, 200 to zero.\nIn place of the rule that a team that is within 100 of the target if a target score cannot score points unless they bid, some play the following version. A team that is within 50 (or other agreed amount) of the target score cannot score unless they actually win the bidding and play the contract or defeat (box) the contractor. This makes it impossible for both teams to reach or pass the target in the same deal.\nNumber of cards\nSome play with hands of 10 cards each - so all the cards down to 5 are used for the game without a kitty, and if playing with a kitty the 4\'s are included as well. Denis Landry reports that the 10-card game (without a kitty) is more usual in South-East New Brunswick. In North-East New Brunswick, 200 is usually played with 9-card hands.\nAnother rarely played version is with 12-card hands and a kitty, using a full 52-card deck for four players.\nMinimum bid\nWhen playing variations that are favourable to the contractor, such as 200 with a kitty, some set the minimum bid higher, for example at 65 or higher.\nOn the other hand, the game \'Le Ruff\' as described in Richard Raymond\'s book, there is no minimum bid, though it is said that bids below 35 are unusual. If the first  three players pass, the dealer simply becomes the contractor and chooses trumps, with no minimum points requirement.\nNo Trump Contract\nSome allow the bidder to announce a no trump (sans atout) game in which there is no trump suit. No trump games score double: the bidding team score twice the number of points they took if they are successful and lose twice the amount bid if they fail. Their opponents score twice the value of the cards in the tricks that they take.\nCompulsory trump lead\nSome play that the first card led by the contractor determines the trump suit, and thus do not allow a non-trump to be led to the first trick.\nDeal variations and Misdeal\nSome prefer to deal the cards one or two at a time. Some deal cards in a single batch, nine at a time.\nWhen playing with a kitty, some deal the four kitty cards singly at any points during the deal.\nAs in many other card games, some like to play with a rule that a player who has been dealt no aces or face cards (i.e. no card above a 10) can call a "misdeal".  The cards are thrown in, shuffled and cut again and the same dealer deals again.\nLe Rough\nThis variant from Quebec is played with a kitty but using only 36 cards: each player is dealt eight cards (4 at a time) and there is a four card kitty (mise), dealt in two cards at a time or all at once at any time during the deal. The minimum bid is 70 and the dealer is allowed to keep (garder) the bid. The bidder takes the kitty and may discard any four cards, which count for the bidder\'s team. The bidder\'s first lead determines the trump suit unless the bidder announces "sans atout" in which case the hand is played without trumps.\nThe target score is 350 points. If the bidder\'s team does not have a negative score, the bidder may, before taking the kitty, announce that the bidder\'s team will win all 100 card points. In this case, if they succeed they win the whole game, but if they lose the other team wins.\nSome play that if the first three players pass, the dealer must also pass. This puts pressure in the dealer\'s partner to bid at least 70, so that the dealer will not be forced to pass with a good hand.\nSix-player game\nSix players can play as two teams of three, sitting alternately, or as three teams of two, with partners facing each other. Using the normal 36-card pack each player is dealt 6 cards; if playing with a kitty 40 cards are used. Alternatively, a 6-player game with kitty can be played with the full 52-card pack, dealing 8 cards to each player. The "misdeal" rule is not be used with six players, since cards without aces or face cards are more frequent.\nThe bidding, play and scoring work the same way as in the four-player game.\nIn the game between three pairs, if a team loses by reaching the lower threshhold (minus 200 points in the 200-point game) while at least one other team has a zero or positive score, the losing team drops out while the other two teams keep their scores and continue playing a four-player game to determine the winners.\n200 with a Pot\nThis variation of the six-player game is played between three teams of two, using 40 cards, with 6 cards dealt to each player and a kitty of 4 cards.\n\nAt the start of the game, everyone pays the agreed ante (say one dollar) into a pot. \nIf the contracting team does not succeed their bid, each member of that team puts 50 cents (or whatever is decided) into the pot.  \nIf a bid suceeds, nobody pays, with one exception: if a team takes all 100 points in tricks (even if the bid is lower than 100), then everyone else puts in the cost of a lost bid (50 cents or whatever was decided).\nIf a hand is thrown in, all players passing, then each member of the dealer\'s team pays the cost of a lost bid (50 cents or whatever was decided).\n\nThe team that wins the game (500 points) divides the pot between them.\nFive-player Game\nI have been told that a five-player game exists using 40 cards (down to the 5). Each player is dealt 8 cards and there is no kitty. One player is a "silent partner" and plays as the partner of the winner of the bidding, the other four players bidding against each other.\nI do not know how the silent partner is chosen. The description I have says that this player has no team or score, and does not shuffle, deal or bid, which would suggest that the same player is dummy for the whole game. It would be fairer to rotate the partner with the deal - for example the player to dealer\'s right could be the silent partner (dummy).\nFor a more interesting five-player game I would suggest the following format. All players take part in the bidding, and the winning bidder calls a card whose holder will be the contractor\'s partner for that hand only. The partner does not announce who he or she is - this will become clear when the called card appears in the course of play. Each player\'s score is kept individually, the holder of the called card scoring the same as the contractor, and the other three players all scoring the points taken by their temporary team. This five-player format is successfully used in several other games, but I have not yet heard of it being used for 200.\nCutthroat 200\nIt is possible to play 200 without partners. The contractor plays alone against all the other players. Presumably each individual player scores the points taken in tricks, except that a contractor with insufficient points loses the amount of the bid. If playing this without a kitty, the minimum bid should perhaps be lowered.\nTwo Players\nUsing a 36-card pack, each player has a 9-card hand, and a "silent partner" whose cards are dealt in three stacks of three: two cards face down with a face-up card on top. \nThe game proceeds like the four-player game. The silent partners cannot bid, and when it is a silent partner\'s turn to play, the live partner plays one of the silent partner\'s face-up cards and turns the next card of the stack face up when the trick is complete. Like the live players, the silent partners must follow suit if possible, taking account only of the visible cards.\nTactics\nBidding\nA good hand for bidding is one with aces or other high cards, preferably in sequence, and with an unbalanced distribution including one or two long suits. Point cards other than aces are a liability.\nWhen the non-dealer\'s team is within 100 of the target, the first player will normally start with a low bid even with weak cards to make sure they can score their tricks if the dealer\'s team wins the bidding. Since a bid of 50 might be made purely for this tactical reason, the first player will probably start with at least 55 if holding genuine values, to let partner know that the bid was based on some strength.\nIf the dealer\'s team is within 100 of the target, the first player will often open with a high bid, to try to shut out the dealer\'s team or tempt them to bid too high.\nKitty\nWhen playing with a kitty, the kitty may improve the contractor\'s hand, but may sometimes make it worse. Best are aces or other high cards, or cards of your long suit. Worst are point cards, especially in your short suits - these can ruin an otherwise good hand.\nWhen discarding, the contractor will try to throw cards in weak, short suits, if possible getting rid of one or two suits entirely, so that the opponents\' aces in those suits can be cut.\nPlay\nAs in any trick-taking game, players should try to keep track of the cards that have been played, especially trumps, high cards and point cards. The winning bidder usually makes the last few tricks (he usually ends up with a trump or two). Knowing the exact trump position can greatly simplify your play. If you\'re with this player and know how many trumps he has, you know how and when you can save your points. This is even more important if he\'s not in your team. If you know how many trumps your oppenent has, you\'ll know if and when you should gamble your point cards.\nThe person who won the bid likely has the most trump cards. Therefore, the contractor\'s team will usually start by trying to draw all the opponents\' trump cards by repeatedly leading trumps. There are a few exceptions. For example if your partner won the bid and you can trump a suit, you may want to keep back your trump cards rather than leading them and hope to cut (trumpo) an opponent\'s ace. Later in the hand the contractor\'s partner should try to win tricks that will enable the contractor to dispose safely of endangered point cards in non-trump suits.\nAs in any partnership game, you should help your partner. For example when partner is winning the trick, you can throw a count card that might otherwise have been lost, but usually not an ace, since it might win a trick later. If your partner won the bid and you know he can cut (trump) a given suit, by all means lead that suit. He will be able to get rid of his unwanted cards (or cut if there are points in the trick).\nIf your team didn\'t win the bid, play your non-trump aces as soon as possible. Many players are tempted to keep their aces instead of playing them on a trick with no other points. This is a big gamble that should only be taken under exceptionnal circumstances. The reverse is true if your team won the bid and all of your opponents\' trump cards have been played - now you can keep aces to capture other point cards. However, you should be careful, especially if your partner won the bid. Everyone will know you have that ace and your partner may not have another card of that suit to lead to it, in which case you risk that the suit will never be led again and you will have to throw your ace on an opponent\'s trick at the end.\nIf the opposing team won the contract, play suits that havn\'t been played yet. You want your partner to play his aces and minimise the risk of being cut. Also, if there are aces left in play and your partner is the only player who hasn\'t led to a trick, there\'s a good chance that he\'s got that ace. Therefore is a good idea to lead a point card of that suit, especially if you have several point cards - you\'re not going to save them all, so you might as well try it.\nIf your team won the bid, you usually want to stay clear of leading a suit that hasn\'t been played yet (unless you have the ace, of course). Instead, try to make it so that either you or your partner can cut suits that havn\'t been played (because the ace of that suit is probably in your opponent\'s hand). If you must lead a suit that hasn\'t been played yet, play a suit in which you have a protected 10. This way, your opponents can\'t score so many points in that trick.\nIf you only have K-5 (or even K-10) of a given suit, you should almost always lead the 5 (or 10). You were probably going to lose it anyway, and this way, you will probably win the second trick in that suit.\nOther 200 web pages\nOn Facebook, Amlie Aubut has published the rules of Le Dix in Acadian French.\nThe Ange Hereux site has rules in French for Le Rough.\nHere is a version of La Barouche described in English by Stella Johnson and Francis Fisher.\n\nThis page is mainly based on information contributed by: Tony Bleyer, Martin Bourgeois, Andre Caissie, Claude Foley, Ann Fulton, John Furlong, Paul Gareau, Serge Guilbert, Denis Landry, Clarence Lavertu, Chris Leblanc, Dax Oliver and Cleo Saulnier.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > King-Ten-Five group > Two Hundred\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2006, 2012, 2013, 2014.

The object in these games is that to be the first to get rid of all your cards. There is a single discard pile and at your turn you can discard a card which matches the rank or the suit of the previous card. If you cannot or do not wish to play, you draw a card from the undealt stock and add it to your hand.\n\nCertain card ranks may have special properties. For example \n\nchanging the direction of play;\nrequiring a different suit to be played;\nrequiring the next player to draw cards;\ncausing the next player\'s turn to be skipped;\nallowing the player to play one or more additional cards.\n\n\nBartok takes this a stage further by allowing the rules about special cards to be changed by the players as the game goes on. This makes the rules increasingly difficult to remember, and anyone who does not follow the rules has to draw one or more penalty cards. The most successful players will be those who are best at keeping abreast of the changes, and inventing new rules which will confuse the other players.\n\nDetailed rules for Bartok (also called Bartog or Warthog) can be found on the following pages. Most of them are Australian, which suggests that perhaps Bartok is of Australian origin, or at least is especially popular there.\n\n\nRules of Bartog, from the nomic ftp site.\nBARTOK / Warthog-- self-modifying game - Lisa Dusseault\'s page.\nBartok - David Mar\'s page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Matching games > Eights Group > Bartok\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1995, 2004.

All threes and nines  are wild and fours give the player an extra card. The numbers are chosen because of their significance in the American sport - three strikes, three outs, nine innings, four balls for a walk. Because of the extra cards dealt after fours, this game cannot be played by more than six people without the risk of running out of cards. \nThe deal is as in seven card stud: two cards face down, four face up and the last face down. There are five betting rounds, one after each round of face up cards and one after the final card is dealt. Each betting round is begun by the player with the highest hand showing at the time. If the cards run out in a seven-player game, it will be necessary to deal the last card as a face up community card instead of dealing a down-card to each player.\nIn the showdown the highest five-card poker hand wins. All threes and nines are wild and can be used as any card not already present in the player\'s hand, or as a fifth card of any rank to make five of a kind, which is the highest hand type - see also poker ranking with wild cards.\nIf a player is dealt a four face up, the player is immediately dealt an extra face up card before the next player receives a card. Such players will have eight, nine or more cards at the showdown.\nVariants \nSome play that a player who is dealt a three face up must immediately either match the pot or fold. Some only require a fixed payment to the pot as an alternative to folding.\nSome play that face down fours also entitle the player to an extra card. Practice varies as to when the player should reveal the four and claim the extra card, and whether the extra card is dealt face up or face down. Possible rules for claiming extra cards for face down fours are:\n\nthe four must be revealed as soon as it is dealt, and the extra card is dealt immediately;\nany concealed fours are revealed in clockwise order and extra cards given immediately before the next betting round;\nconcealed fours may be revealed whenever the holder wishes, and an extra card is given as soon as the four is revealed.\n\nSome play that the extra card given when a four appears must be paid for. The price may be a fixed amount paid to the pot or may vary according to whether the extra card is face up or face down, and how late in the game it is dealt.\nThe wild cards and the card which entitles the player to an extra card can of course be varied. For example in Football threes and sixes are wild and you get an extra card for a two. In Woolworth fives and tens are wild and you get an extra card for a two.\nNo Peek\nThe dealer deals seven cards face down to each player. Players must not look at their cards.\nThe player to dealer\'s left flips his or her first card face up, and starts the first betting round.\nThe next active player in clockwise order then flips up cards until showing a hand that beats the first player\'s card, and then begins a second betting round. For example if the first player flipped a 9 and the second player a jack, the second betting round starts immediately. If the first player flips a 9 and the second player a 5, the second player must flip another card. Suppose it is a seven. 7-5 still does not beat the 9 so a third card must be flipped. If this is another 5, the second player now has a pair, which beats the 9, so the second betting round starts.\nThis continues clockwise around the table. At your turn, if you have not folded, you must flip cards until you have the best poker hand showing, and then begin a new betting round. If you flip all seven of your cards and still do not have the highest hand showing you must drop out: there is no betting round and the turn passes to the next active player.\nThis continues until all cards are face up or there is only one player left in. The highest hand wins the pot.\nWhen comparing hands, any kicker beats a missing card, so for example 7-3 beats a 7 by itself. Flushes and straights must have five cards to count. See poker ranking - incomplete hands for details.\nVariants\nSome begin by turning up a card from a second deck. The player to dealer\'s left must start by flipping cards until able to beat this card, before beginning the first round of betting.\nSome play with back betting. When a player flips all seven cards without beating the best hand, and is thereby knocked out, there is a round of betting begun by the best hand showing before the next player begins flipping cards.\nMexican Sweat\nIn this variant of No Peek, seven cards are dealt to each player and one face up in the middle of the table. The first player must beat this face up card before the first betting round begins.\nIf any player flips one of the three cards of the same rank as the face up card in the middle, that player must immediately fold. By prior agreement there may or may not be a betting round before the next player starts flipping cards.\nNight Baseball\nThis game, also known as Midnight Baseball or No Peek Baseball, is a combination of Baseball and No Peek.\nThe deal and the procedure for flipping  cards are the same as in No Peek, but as in Baseball, all threes and nines are wild. \nAny player who flips a four is immediately dealt an extra card face down from the deck.\nVariants\nAll Baseball and No Peek variants can be used here too. For example players may have to pay or fold when flipping a three. They may have to pay for the extra card dealt when a four appears. The first player may have to beat a card truned up from another deck before the first betting round. "Back betting" may or may not be included.  \nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly \nThe deal and betting are the same as in seven-card stud, with the following modifications.\nAfter the initial deal of two down cards and one up card to each player, three cards are dealt face down to the table.\nAfter \tthe fourth card is dealt to each player, the dealer turns one of the table cards face up. This is The Good: all players\' cards which are the same rank as this card are wild.\nAfter the fifth card is dealt, \tthe second table card is turned face up. This is The Bad: all cards of \tthe same rank as this card must be discarded. \nAfter the sixth card is dealt, \t the final table card is turned face up. This is The Ugly: anyone who has \tan up card of the same rank as The Ugly must immediately fold. \nAfter the seventh card is dealt, the final betting round and showdown take place as usual. Note that the three face up cards on the table are not shared (community) cards - they cannot be used by players to complete their hands. \nSequence      \n          The deal and betting are same as in seven-card stud. \n\nIf a two is dealt as a face-up card, all twos become wild.\nIf a three is dealt face up when twos are wild, twos cease to be wild and threes become wild instead.\nIf a four is dealt face up while threes are wild, threes cease to be wild and fours become wild instead.\nAnd so on...\n\nNote that for the wild card to be created and changed, the upcards must appear in increasing order, starting with the two. If a three is dealt face up before a two appears, there is no wild card yet. If a two appears subsequently, twos are wild, not threes, despite the presence of the previously dealt three. The wild cards do not have to be consecutive: if the upcards are 6, 2, Q, 5, 3, 9, 4, A in that order, 4\'s are wild.\nAt the showdown, the high hand wins the pot. \nAlternatively, the game can be played high/low with declaration.\nSecond Hand High\nThe deal and betting are the same as in seven-card stud, but if there is a showdown, the second highest hand wins.\nIf all but one player fold, the surviving player wins as usual.\nThe Game Report site, which described this variant, did not specify how to deal with ties. I suggest that if there is a tie for first place, none of those equal hands wins but the next highest hand takes the pot. If there is a tie for second place, the equal hands should split the pot.\nJack the Shifter\nFor this game to work, the group must have an agreed list of seven-card stud games that they normally play. The game begins as ordinary seven-card stud played for high, but whenever a jack is dealt as an upcard, the player who receives the jack can change the game to any seven-card stud game on the agreed list.\nAn explicit or implicit agreement on the list of allowable games is needed to prevent a player who receives a jack inventing a new game on the fly to favour the particular hole cards he has been dealt.\nIn addition, a player who is dealt a face-down jack may reveal it at any time before the final round of betting and  name a game.  Immediately before the final betting round, the dealer offers each player in turn a final chance to reveal a jack, after which no fiurther changes are possible.\nThe high hand wins the pot, unless the winning condition has been changed by a player with a jack.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Baseball / No Peek\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2011.

From 1815 to 1920 this was the Prussian province Posen, with  1/3 German and 2/3 Polish population, which explains the strong German influence on the game. The word "kop" means "kick" in Polish, but the name is most likely a polonisation of the German word "Kopf".   Kop is a very fast game: a single deal can take less than twenty seconds. It is mostly played for money, but there are also tournaments held in some towns and villages around the region. People can often be found playing it in trains (sometimes without a table, standing, holding the tricks in their hands). Cab drivers have been seen playing it on a roof of a cab.  \nA similar game called "Baka" is  played in the region of Cashubia (part of Pomerania, around Gdansk). Together with Skat, which is played in Silesia, these are examples of Schafkopf-derived games introduced to western Poland under German influence, as can be seen from some of the technical terms used. The card points are oko (eyes), equivalent to German Augen, and the black Queens are stare (old ones), equivalent to die Alten in German, zolo du equivalent to Solo Tout and so on.\nBoth Kop and Baka can be played online on the Polish Kurnik server, though neither game is currently available on the English version of this server at PlayOK.com.\nPlayers and Cards\nThe Kop deck contains only 16 cards. Aces, Tens, Queens and Jacks of each suit are used. It is usually played with French-suited cards, which are easy to obtain in Poland.  \nThere are four players, who most of the time play in partnerships, the holders of the two black Queens playing together against the other two. The game is dealt and played clockwise.\nAs in most games of this type, the point values of the cards are:  A=11, 10=10, Q=3, J=2. The total value of the cards in the pack is only 104 (not 120 as in Skat or Schafkopf, because the 4-point Kings are not used).  Aces and Tens are called cae (wholes) because of their high value. The card points are called oka (singular oko) (eyes).\nAs in many Schafkopf games, all the Queens and Jacks are trumps, but above them, the highest trumps are the Ace and Ten of hearts, and below them are the Ace and Ten of diamonds. The makes 12 trumps in all, leaving only four cards that are not trumps, in two suits, clubs and spades. The trumps are called trumfy, and the non-trump suits are obce (meaning foreign or strange). Among the Queens and Jacks, the usual order ranking clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds is used. So in summary, there are three very unequal suits, ranking from high to low as follows:\n\nTrumps: A-10-Q-Q-Q-Q-J-J-J-J-A-10\nClubs: A-10\nSpades: A-10\n\nThe black Queens, which determine the partnerships, are called stare (old ones). The lowest two cae trumps - the A and 10 - are  called ryzyka (risks).\nDeal and Bidding\nThe dealer shuffles and the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The dealer then deals out all 16 cards, one at a time, so that each player has four. There are advantages and disadvantages to being the dealer. To even these out, the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nBefore the play begins, the players have an opportunity to make announcements, such as to increase the stake for the game, or to volunteer to play without a partner. Officially, they should speak in clockwise order, starting with the player to dealer\'s left. That procedure may be followed in formal tournaments, but in practice players simply make their announcements without waiting for the other players. The player to dealer\'s left looks at the other players and asks \'May I?\', and if no one responds simply starts the play by leading the first card.\nThe possible announcements are as follows:\n\nKontra\n This doubles the value of the game. After a player has said "kontra", another player can reply with "re" or "rej", then "bok" can be announced and then "sup". Each of these bids doubles the previous value the game, provided that the players are on different sides. Since at this point in the game the partnerships are usually unknown, it is possible that consecutive doubles may be announced by players who turn out to be partners. A series of two or more consecutive doubles by members of the same team count as only one double. Example: East deals, South says "kontra", West says "re", North says "bok" and West says "sup". If North and South are partners against East and West the game value is multiplied by 16; if West and South are partners against East and North the kontra and re count as just one double and the game value is multiplied by 8; if South and East are partners against North and West the last three doubles count as one and the game value is multiplied by 4 only. In tournaments sup is the highest double allowed, but in private games further doubles may be permitted. These higher doubles often have colourful  names such as: "dupa Lenina" (Lenin\'s arse), "dupa Bieruta" (Bierut\'s arse - Bierut was the president of Poland from 1947 to 1952) or "wsy Stalina" (Stalin\'s moustache).  \nWesele\n Wesele (wedding) may be announced by a player who holds both black Queens, in order to obtain a partner, as described below. \n Zolo \nThe player who announces Zolo plays alone against the other three players in partnership. Alternatively, it is possible to announce Zolo Du, which is an undertaking to win all four tricks, playing alone. (The names of these announcements are phonetic transcriptions into Polish of the "Solo" and "Solo Tout" bids from Schafkopf).\n\nNotes:\nZolo du is the highest bid, followed by zolo and then wesele. Only the highest bid is played: for example if one player announces wesele and another player zolo, only the zolo is played and the wesele is cancelled. \nAn announcement of "wesele", "zolo" or "zolo du" cancels any previously announced doubles - "kontra", "rej", etc. However, the announcements continue until three players in succession have passed, so the other players have an opportunity to say kontra to the new bid of wesele, zolo or zolo du.\nA player who announces "wesele", "zolo" or "zolo du" is not allowed to double the value of their own bid by saying say "kontra", but if another player doubles it with "kontra", they are allowed to redouble with "rej", etc. \nPartnerships\nA player who announces  zolo or zolo du plays alone, and the other three players form a team against the zolo player. In other cases the partnerships depend on the distribution of the cards. \nIf "old queens" are held by different players, the players who hold the Q and Q play together as partners. They are called "starzy" (the old ones) the other two players form a partnership called "modzi" (the young ones). If both black  queens happen to be held by one player, that player has three options:\n\n Call "wesele". In this case she will be paired with the holder of the    highest Jack that she doesn\'t hold (so for example if she holds J but not    J, the holder of the J will be her partner). \n Say nothing. In this case she plays alone, though the other players will not initially be aware of this. This is called "cicha" (the    silent).   \n Announce "zolo" or "zolo du". The announced "zolo" is worth more points than    "cicha", but the opponents know from the start that they are all on the same side.     \n\nThe partnerships become known after the cards mentioned above are played. They can  of course often be deduced earlier. For example,  player who is unable to beat  a Jack cannot be "old". If someone plays a \'ryzyko\' on a trick that will be taken by another player, she probably is that player\'s partner and is "smearing" (but it is also possible that she had no other card to play). \nPlay\n The player to the left of the dealer always leads to the first trick. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if no trumps are played by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each  trick leads to the next. Any card  can be led. Players must follow suit (all trumps count as belonging to the trump suit and not to the suits printed on the cards), and subject to this, must beat the highest card in the trick if they can. In practice this means:\n\nIf a non-trump ("obca") is led and another player holds the other card of this suit (in the "as-dycha" variation), she must play it at her turn.  \nIn all other cases,  the player must play a trump, and if possible  beat the highest trump so far played to the trick. If unable to beat the highest trump in the trick, the player must play some other trump.\nThe only case in which a player is allowed to play an "obca" (non-trump) from a suit other than the suit led is when the player has   no trumps and no card of the suit that was led. \n There is only one possibility to take a trick with an "obca". If all 12 trumps are played in the first three tricks, then the last trick will contain all four  "obce" were played. In this   case the Ace of the suit that was led takes the trick. In all other cases the highest trump wins the trick.\n\nScoring\n At the end of the play, each team counts the value of the cards in the tricks it has won.   In fact, an experienced player can see the result immediately  just by looking at the tricks of one of the partnerships, without counting the points aloud. The objective of the game is to take the majority of points, that is at least 53. If there is 52-52 tie it is called "boki" (sides). In this case the team that announced the last double  loses. If no one doubled, the "old" players lose if playing two against two, or the lone player loses if playing one against three.  \nIf the losing party took 26 points or more, it is called "wyjcie" (going out). If they have 25 points or fewer, the  situation is called "bez wyjcia" which is equivalent of Schneider in German games.\nIf playing for money, the players should decide in advance the basic value of a point.  In an ordinary game or wesele each losing player will pay this basic amount and each winning player will receive the same amount. If the game was lost "bez wyjcia" this payment is doubled, but if the losing players took no tricks (bez bitki - like Schwarz in German games) it is tripled instead.  \nIf a player wins when playing alone, each of the other three players will pay the winner:\n\n 4  the basic amount for cicha;\n 5  the basic amount for zolo;\n 10  the basic amount for zolo du.\n\n A player who loses alone will  pay the same amount to every other player. There is no extra payment for "wyjcie" or winning all the tricks in cicha or zolo. A zolo du is won only if the lone player wins all four tricks; otherwise it is lost.\nEvery "double" announcement (kontra, rej, etc.)  doubles the payment for the game (so for example zolo with rej will cost 20  the basic value). However if the consecutive doubles were announced by players that happened to be partners, they count as a single double.\nVariations\n\nThe card order in the version of the game described above is the classic one, known as "as - dycha" (ace - ten). More recently, some people have begun to use an order called "as - trzy dychy" (ace - three tens) in which the black tens are also promoted above the club Queen, so that there are 14 trumps and just one card in each non-trump suit. The order then becomes:\n    \nTrumps: A-10-10-10-Q-Q-Q-Q-J-J-J-J-A-10\nClubs: A\nSpades: A\n\n\nSome allow a player to say kontra to her own wesele, through not to her own zolo or zolo du.\nThere is a simpler variation of wesele in which the holder of the black Queens specifies the Jack whose holder will be her partner, calling  "dupek X na wesele"    (Jack of suit X for a wedding). This variation is  less interesting than the standard game above. When the card is not named,  the holder of the J and even the J can\'t be sure at the outset whether she is playing with    or against the caller of "wesele".\n\nBaka\nThis Cashubian game is described in Polish at psbaski.pl. It is said to have been played in that region since the 19th century. "Baka" is a diminutive of the name Barbara, and is also the name given to a hand of four Queens, the highest bid in this game.\nThe game is very similar to Kop, as described above, in the classic version with 12 trumps and two black suits of two cards each. However, Baka has some extra bids, and the scoring is slightly different. \nThere are four possible levels of doubling: kontra, rekontra, bok and hirsh. \nIf there is no higher bid, the holders of the two black Queens are partners, and an ordinary game is played, or if the black Queens are in the same hand, the holder plays alone silently (a Cicha). Six higher bids are possible. In ascending order, these are:\n\nWesele\nThe same as in Kop. The player has both black Queens and chooses to have the player with the highest Jack among the other players as a partner.\nGran\nThe bidder plays alone and tries to take a majority of card points, as in a Zolo, but the order of cards is different. The four Jacks are the only trumps, and there are four non-trump suits of three cards each, as follows: \n    \nTrumps:-J-J-J-J\n      \nClubs: A-10-Q\n      \nSpades: A-10-Q\n      \nHearts: A-10-Q\n      \nDiamonds: A-10-Q\n      \n\n\nZolo\nThe same as in Kop. The bidder plays alone and tries to take the majority of points.\nGran Du\nThe cards rank the same way as in Gran, and in order to win the bidder has to take all four tricks, playing alone.\nZolo Du\nThe same as in Kop. The bidder has to win all four tricks alone, with the normal card ranking.\nBaka\nThe bidder has all four Queens. There is no play: the bidder automatically wins with this hand.\n\n\nPlayers speak in clockwise rotation and may bid, each bid being higher than the last, or double the previous bid. The highest bid is played, with any subsequent doubles. Players cannot say kontra to their own bid, but can redouble if another player says kontra.\nThe basic scores are:\n\n\nSimple game\n1\n\n\nWesele\n1\n\n\nCicha\n4\n\n\nGran\n5\n\n\nZolo\n5\n\n\nGran Du\n10\n\n\nZolo Du\n10\n\n\nBaka\n10\n\n\nA simple game, Wesele, Cicha, Gran or Zolo is won by the player or team that has more card points. In case of a 52-52 tie, the side that announced the last double loses, or if no one said kontra, the "old" team (the team with the black Queens) loses when two play against two and the lone player loses when playing against three. In Gran Du and Zolo Du the lone player wins if she takes all four tricks and loses otherwise. In Baka, the player with the four Queens automatically wins.\nIn a simple game or Wesele, the score is increased to 2 if the losing side took at least one trick but had 25 or fewer points, or 3 if they won no tricks at all.\nUnlike Kop, if the "old" players (the black Queen holders) lose in a simple game or wesele, or if the lone player loses in a game played one against three, the score is doubled.\nAlso, the score is doubled for kontra, rekontra, etc., but two or more consecutive doubles by players who turn out to be on the same team count as only one double.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Schafkopf group > Kop\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2013.

This page is based mainly on four accounts: \nThe first is from Bonnie Smith, who was taught the game by an Egyptian, but says that it is widely played in coffee houses throughout the Middle East; \nThe second was contributed by Alexey Lobashev, based on a description by Mr. Akabat Ibragim Khusim from the town of Sana, Yemen, who had played Basra for several years, also with a teacher from Egypt. Another name for the game is Assaba-al\'-Komi. Adults only play it, not children. \nThe third is a description of the version played in the Lebanon, contributed by Toni Matni.\nThierry Depaulis has found another short description Lebanese Basra by Fuad I. Khuri, which is reproduced near the end of the page; the book from which this comes also gives the alternative name Ashush. \n\nI would be interested to hear from anyone who can tell me more about Basra or Ashush or Assaba-al\'-Komi; corrections or further variations of the rules, details of where the game is played, or any other relevant information would be welcome. \nPlayers and cards\n\nA standard 52 card pack is used. The descriptions I have been given of the Egyptian version are for two or four players. If there are four players, partners sit opposite each other.\n\nDeal and Play\n\nThe cards are shuffled and the person to the left of the dealer cuts.  The dealer may look at the bottom card of the pack after it has been cut. \n\nThe dealer then gives the four cards to each player, beginning with his right hand opponent, going around the table anticlockwise, and ending with himself. The next 4 cards are turned face up in the middle of the table. The area where the face up cards are set out is known as the "floor" - maybe the game was originally played on the floor, though nowadays it is normal to play on a table. If the cards on the floor include any jacks or the seven of diamonds, the dealer buries these cards in the undealt pack and replaces them by dealing new cards to the floor from the top of the undealt cards. \n\nThe player to dealer\'s right plays first and the turn to play passes anticlockwise. Each turn consists of playing one card face up to the floor and possibly capturing some of the cards that are there. Captured cards are placed face down in front of the player who captured them. When there are four players, partners keep the cards they have captured together in a single pile. When all players have played their four cards, the dealer gives them each another batch of four from the undealt cards (but no more cards are dealt to the floor) and play continues. When the whole pack has been dealt and the players have played their last four cards the play ends. The hand is scored and the turn to deal passes to the right.\n\nCapturing and the Basra\n\nIf you play a card whose rank matches one of the cards on the floor, you capture that card, and place both the card you played and the captured card face down in front of you. For example a 7 captures a 7, a queen captures a queen, and so on.\n\n\nIf you play a numeral card whose value is equal to the sum of the values of some cards on the floor, then your card captures that group of cards. For example if the floor contains 3, 4, 5 and 8 and you play a 9, you capture the 5 and 4 and place the 5, 4 and 9 in your capture pile. Aces have a capture value of 1, so if the floor contains A, 2, 6 you can capture the ace and two by playing a 3, or ace and 6 with a 7 or all three cards with a 9.\n\nIt is possible to make more than one capture with the same play. For example, if the floor shows a 4, 6, 10 and 3 and you play a 10, you capture the 10 and the 4 and the 6 from the floor along with the 10 that you played.\n\nIf you play a card that does not match anything, it stays face up on the floor, and is available for capture in future turns. \n\nNote that there is no obligation to play a card that makes a capture just because you can - if you have a card that does not match, you can add it to the floor if you wish to. However, if you play a card which does make a capture, you must make the capture.\n\nQueens and kings have no numerical value. A queen can capture or be captured by a queen and a king can capture or be captured by a king. The only other way to capture a queen or king is to play a special card (jack or seven of diamonds - see below).\n\nA basra occurs when a player captures all the cards from the floor, leaving it empty. The player scores a 10 point bonus for this, and the capturing card is placed faced up in the player\'s capture pile, as a way of remembering the bonus when the time comes to score the hand.\n\nJacks have a special property. If you play a jack when there are cards on the floor, it captures all the cards from the floor, leaving it empty, but this does not count as a basra and scores no bonus. If you play a jack when the floor is empty it does not capture anything, but just remains on the floor.\n\nThe seven of diamonds behaves in a similar way to a jack - it captures everything on the floor. If the cards on the floor are all numerals, and their values add up to 10 or less, this counts as a basra, and scores the 10 point bonus. If the floor adds up to more than ten, or includes picture cards, the 7 still takes all the cards but it does not count as a basra. If you play the 7 to an empty floor it stays there (and can be captured later just like a normal seven).\n\nAfter the last card has been played, any cards that remain on the floor are taken by the player who last made a capture, but this does not count as a basra.\n\nScoring\n\nWhen all 52 cards have been played, the cards in each team\'s stack are counted.  The team that has the majority of the cards (27 or more) scores 30 points. If it is a tie, each team having 26 cards, these 30 points are held in abeyance, and added to the score for the majority of cards on the next hand. So on the next hand, the team which takes more cards will win 60 points (30+30).   \n\nIn addition one point is scored for each jack and each ace in your pile, two points for the 2 and 3 points for the 10, plus 10 points for each basra, as already mentioned. Thus the total points to be scored in each hand are 43 plus 10 for each basra. \n\nWhichever team reaches a score of 101 points first wins the game. It is possible that both teams reach 101 in the same hand. In that case the team with the higher score wins, and in case of a tie, more hands are played until the tie is broken. \n\nIt is usual to play the best of five games - the player who wins three games wins the match and the loser pays for the shisa and beverages which have been consumed in great quantities all through play. If after four games, the players have won two each, then by common agreement decisive fifth game is played to 150 points rather than 101.\n\nCustoms and Tactics\n\nIt is important to remember the cards that have been played. Towards the end you know what cards your opponent is likely to have and what has already been played and you can use this knowledge to collect valuable cards. An important tactic is to clear the floor with a jack when you know that your opponent\'s next play to the empty floor is likely to give you a basra. In the last deal of the hand, if both players have been concentrating they will each know exactly what four cards the other has and can play accordingly.\n\nBonnie Smith writes that experts normally play in a constant state of movement - of themselves, of the cards - cards are moving all the time; much like a shell game.  There is no overt cheating - it is drama and an attempt to distract the concentration of the opponent.\n\nVariations\n\nIn the version reported by Bonnie Smith (which is for two players), the bottom card of the pack is shown to both players after the cut so that each knows what the last card will be.\n\nMuntaha Haddad describes a variant played in Jordan, in which the score for a basra is twice the face value of the card used to make the capture, picture cards counting as 10 for this purpose. For example a basra with a 7 scores 14 points and a basra in which a Queen captures a lone Queen from the table score 20 points.  The rest of the rules are the same as in the main description above. \n\nIn the version described by Alexey Lobashev, there are the following differences:  \n\nAlthough the capturing of all the cards from the floor by a jack does not normally count as a basra, there is one exception. If you play a jack when there is only one card on the floor and this card is also a jack, this counts as a \'double basra\', and it is counted as 20 rather than 10. It is not clear whether this rule is used in Egypt, or whether it is a variation from Yemen. \nWhen the seven of diamonds is played, it counts as a basra in the following cases:\n\nThe total value of the cards on the floor is less than 10 (not if it is equal to 10)\nThe only card(s) on the floor are tens, queens and kings\nThe cards on the floor can be divided into two or more groups which score an equal number of points, less than 10. For example capturing A-2-7-8 with the 7 would be a basra, because (1+8)=(2+7)=9.\n\nThe Egyptian game was said to be played to a target of 121 points, though the target in Yemen was 101 points. \n\n\n\nBasra in Lebanon\n\nThe game is for two or four players. Four play in teams of two against two, partners sitting opposite. A standard international 52 card pack is used. The turn to deal rotates. The dealer deals 6 cards to each player - all at once - and four cards face up to the middle of the table. The rest of the deck is put to one side to be dealt when the first six cards have been played.\n\nThe scoring values of the cards are: \n\n3 points for the 10\n2 points for the 2\n1 point for each jack\n1 point for each ace\n3 points for whichever player (or team) takes the majority of the cards (if they have 26 cards each, no one gets these points).\n\nThus there are 16 points available altogether unless there is a tie for most cards, in which case there are only 13 points. Note that the majority of cards is worth only 3 (not 30 as in Egypt and Yemen). \n\nThe play is begun by the player who received the first cards in the deal (that is the non-dealer if there are two players and the player to dealer\'s right if there are four). Then the turn to play rotates. The procedure for playing and capturing cards is as described above: a numeral card can capture an equal card or a set of cards that add up to its rank, or both; a jack captures everything on the table; a queen can only capture queens and a king can only capture kings. In this version the 7 has no special power.\n\nIn the Lebanese game, a Basra occurs only in the following two cases:\n\nA single card is left alone on the table - either because all the other cards were captured, or because the table was cleared (perhaps with a jack), forcing the next player to play a single card. If the following player can match this single card (thereby capturing it), this counts as a Basra and scores 10 points. Capturing a lone card other than a jack by playing a jack does not count as a Basra; capturing a lone jack with another jack counts as an ordinary single Basra, not a double one.\nThere is a single card alone on the table, the next player plays a card that does not capture it, and the following player is able to clear the table by playing a card equal to the sum of these two cards. For example, the table contains a lone 3. The next player plays a 4 (perhaps having no other card). If the following player can play a 7, capturing the 3 + 4, this is a Basra, worth 10 points.\n\n\nAfter the players have played all their cards the dealer deals another six cards each (but no more to the table) and play continues. In the two-player game it takes four deals to exhaust the pack; in the four player game there will only be two deals.\n\nAfter the last card has been played, any cards that remain on the table are taken by the player who last made a capture. Then each player or team scores the cards taken plus basras. Further hands are played until either player or team reaches 101 or more points. Then the player or team with the higher score wins.\n\nHere is a description of the same Lebanese game found by Thierry Depaulis in Fuad I. Khuri: "Tents and pyramids: games and ideology in Arab culture from backgammon to autocratic rule." Saqi books, London, 1990, Appendix F, p145-6. It seems that the only difference from the version described above is the possibility of playing with 3 people, in which case the deal would have to be 4 cards at a time rather than 6.\n\nBasra (or ashush)\n\nLike many card games, basra can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players. If with 4, 2 players normally team up against the other 2. But in order to increase the element of competition, people often play as individuals, without teams.\nIn basra, or ashush, cards are distributed to every player in one hump, in sets of 4 or 6 cards at a time. Four other cards are laid face upwards on the floor. The first player, that is the one sitting on the right of the dealer, tries to match the cards on the floor with the cards in his hand: ace matches ace, nine matches nine, king matches king, and so on. The card in the hand \'eats\' the card it matches on the floor. If no cards match, the player then has to throw another card on the floor and the next player takes over. The right to deal rotates at every shuffle.\nA card in the hand could match the sum of the cards on the floor. For example, 9 matches 6 and 3, 2 and 7, 1 and 8, and 5 and 4. The knave (jack), which is called ashush, matches everything; it is an imam that \'eats\' everything else on the floor, which is exactly what the term means in colloquial Arabic. In Bahrain, I have heard people referring to the knave as imam.\nIf a card is laid or left alone on the floor, it becomes vulnerable and could be taken as basra should it match a card in the hand. This could happen by manipulating the jack that eats everything else, thus forcing the next player to throw a lone card on the floor (vulnerablity of isolation).\nThe basra counts as 10, the ace 1, the knave 1; the 10 of diamonds counts as 3, the 2 of clubs as 2, and the player who gets the most cards wins 3 points. The game is won once a player accumulates the sum of 101 points. Aside from the specific cards mentioned above, other cards carry equivalent values with no distinction made between diamonds or hearts, clubs or spades, kings or queens, sevens or fours. The highest value obviously is placed upon the basra, which is a captured lone card, or a \'hostage\'.\nSoftware and Online Games\nBasra can be played online at the Jawaker website.\nYou can play Basra online against a computer opponent at Kongregate.\nYou can download freeware Basra and Ashush programs from Thanos Card Games.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Fishing Games > Basra\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1998, 2006, 2013.

In Trinidad, Barbados and maybe other Caribbean islands it is known as Suck the Well, and in French it is sometimes called Bataille Corse (Corsican battle). Other names for it are Egyptian War or Egyptian Rat Killer and so on, but these names are more commonly used for a more elaborate version version of the game where the pile can also be won by slapping pairs of equal cards - see the Egyptian Ratscrew page for details.\nDivide a standard pack of 52 cards roughly in half. Each of the two players holds their half face down. The players take turns to turn over their top card and play it face up in the centre of the table, thus forming a pile. There are two kinds of card - the ace, king, queen and jack are pay cards and the 2-10 are ordinary cards.\nPlay continues alternately until a pay card appears. The opponent of the person who played the pay card must pay for it by playing several times in succession. The payment rates are: \n\n4 ordinary cards for an ace\n3 ordinary cards for a king\n2 ordinary cards for a queen\n1 ordinary card for a jack\n\nWhen the payment is complete (e.g. A has played a queen and B has played two ordinary cards on it), the person who played the pay card (A in this case) takes the whole face up pile and puts it face down underneath their own cards.\nIt often happens that while paying for a card, you turn over a pay card yourself. When this happens the previous pay card is cancelled and your opponent now has to pay for your new pay card.\nExample: A plays a queen; B plays a six and then a jack; A plays an ace; B plays 3,7,king; A plays 10,4,6. The king has been paid for so B takes the centre pile.\nThe player who first runs out of cards loses.\nThere is no skill in this game (you just turn your top card when it is your turn) and the game can go on for a long time - possibly indefinitely.\nIt is possible for more than two people to play. The cards are dealt as equally as possible (with three players one player will have an extra card) and players take turns to play. When a pay card is played, the following player plays the required number of cards, stopping if another pay card is played, which the next person must pay for. The direction of play in the Caribbean version "Suck the Well" is counter-clockwise, while in Britain and North America the game is played clockwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > War group > Beggar My Neighbour\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2007.

It is an elaborated four-player vesion of the two-player game of Schnapsen, which in turn is based on the German game Sechsundsechszig (Sixty-Six).\nPlayers and cards\nBauernschnapsen is normally played by four people. The players sitting opposite each other are partners. The deal and play are clockwise.\nIt is played with a pack of just 20 cards. Either French suited or German suited (William Tell pattern) cards can be used. The four suits (hearts, diamonds or bells, clubs or acorns, spades or leaves) each contain five cards, and each card has a value in card points. The ranking (from high to low) and point values of the cards are as follows.\n\nFrench suitsGerman suitsCard points\naceace (sow)11\ntenten10\nkingking4\nqueenover3\njackunder2\n\nIn addition, a player who has the king and queen (over) of trumps in hand can declare them when leading one of them to a trick and score 40 card points. The king and queen (over) of a non-trump suit can similarly be declared for 20 card points.\nThe deal\nThe dealer shuffles. The player to dealer\'s right may either cut or just knock on the cards.\nIf the cards were cut, the dealer deals the cards in two rounds - a packet of three cards each followed by a packet of two cards each. After the first three cards have been dealt, and without looking at the last two cards, forehand (the player to the left of the dealer) has to declare the trump suit. This must be a suit of which forehand holds at least one card. If forehand\'s first three cards are unsuitable to choose as a trump suit, forehand has the alternative of designating one of the last two cards at random as trumps. This is called "Aufschlagen". In this case, the dealer deals one of forehand\'s last two cards face-up on the table, and the suit of this card is trumps.\nIf the cards were knocked, the dealer deals them in a single round, five at a time. However, forehand\'s first three cards must be dealt separately, and forehand must either choose a trump suit from these or call for "Aufschlagen", in which case the dealer turns up one of the other two cards to determine trumps.\nThe contracts\nEach hand begins with an auction in which players can bid a contract that they are prepared to play. The highest bidder\'s contract is played. If the bidder\'s team is successful they score a number of game points, depending on the contract; if not their opponents score some game points. Note that game points are entirely separate from card points. The first team to reach a score of 24 or more game points (usually over several deals) will win the game.\nThe following table lists the possible contracts in ranking order from lowest to highest, explains what the objective is how much they score. Note that some contracts can only be bid by certain players.\n\nContractScoreBidderTrumpsFirst leadObjective and notes\nNormal game1, 2 or 3 game points (see below)Forehand onlyAs originally chosen by forehandForehandTo be the first team to reach at least 66 card points, counting cards won in tricks plus points for declaring king-queen (king-over) combinations (see below).\nBettler4 game pointsAnyoneNo trumpsDeclarerThe declarer must lose every trick to win the contract.

Players bid by naming a contract they would like to play. In the bidding, there is an order of priority among the players, forehand having the highest priority, then dealer\'s partner, then forehand\'s partner, then the dealer, who has lowest priority. If more than one player wishes to play the same contract, the player with the higher priority will be allowed to play.\nForehand begins the bidding and cannot pass, but can bid a normal game (for which the trump suit has already been determined) or any of the higher contracts that are available to forehand. The turn to bid passes clockwise, each player either passing or bidding a contract. If the previous contract was bid by a player with higher priority than you, then you must bid a higher contract or pass. If the previous bidder had lower priority than you, you have the extra option of bidding the same contract as the previous bidder. Example: Forehand bids a normal game, then next two players pass and dealer bids a Gang. Forehand can now pass, or bid a Gang, which will have priority over the dealer\'s Gang, or bid higher.\nThe bidding continues around the table for as many circuits as are necessary until three players have passed. A player who has passed is out of the auction and does not get an opportunity to bid on later circuits.\nWhen three players have passed, the fourth player is the declarer, and must play the contract of the last bid. At this stage, either of the opponents of the declarer can say "Kontra", which doubles the score for the game. The declarer or the declarer\'s partner can respond by saying "Rekontra", which doubles the score again. Either opponent can respond to a Rekontra by saying  "Subkontra", which doubles the score yet again, so that in principle the game is worth eight times its original value. However, you should note that since the game is played to a target of 24 game points, once the score for the game is 24 points or more (or sufficient to take either side beyond the game target if they already have a score) there is no purpose in further Kontras.\nThe play\nWhen there are trumps, forehand leads to the first trick. In contracts with no trumps, the declarer leads first.\nPlayers must follow suit if able to, and whenever possible must play a card that beats the highest card so far played to the trick (even when this means beating a high card played by their partner). A player who has no card of the suit led must play a trump if possible. If there is already a trump in the trick, and you are also unable to follow suit, you must trump, beating the highest trump in the trick if possible, but if the trick contains a trump you cannot beat you must still play a (lower) trump. If you have no cards of the suit led and no trumps, you may throw any card.\nA trick is won by the highest trump in it, or by the highest card of the suit led if it contains no trumps.\nSpecial rules for normal game, Schnapser and Kontra-Schnapser only\nA player who holds the king and the queen of a suit (the king and the over if playing with German cards) can declare them when leading one of these two cards to a trick. The player\'s team then scores an extra 20 card points if the K-Q is in a non-trump suit, or an extra 40 card points for the K-Q of trumps. Each combination can only be scored if the holder leads one of the cards as the first card to a trick, while still holding the other card in hand, and shows the other card to claim the bonus. Forehand can do this on the first trick. Any other player would first have to win a trick, and then lead a card of the still intact combination to declare it. It is not necessary to win the trick to which the combination card was led to claim the score.\nIn a normal game, when you believe that your team has at least 66 card points in tricks you have won plus declared combinations, you can stop the play, saying "enough". If the claim is correct your team scores 1, 2 or 3 game points (doubled, redoubled, etc. for any kontras), depending on the card points taken by the other team, as follows:\n\n1 game point if the opponents have taken 33 or more card points\n2 game points if the opponents have taken at least one trick, but fewer than 33 card points\n3 game points if the opponents have taken no tricks\n\nA claim can be made after you have won a trick, or immediately after declaring a combination. If you claim after declaring a combination, the remainder of that trick is not played out, and any card points in it do not count to either side.\n\nUsually it is permitted to look at your side\'s tricks, to check how many card points you have. Therefore false claims should be unusual, but if you do claim and then turn out to be short of the necessary 66 card points, the other team wins the game points that you would have won if the claim had been correct.\nIf no one claims to have won before the lead to last trick, the team that wins the last trick wins 1 game point (doubled for any kontras), irrespective of the number of card points taken by either side.\nIf Schnapser or Kontra-Schnapser is bid, just three tricks are played. To be successful, the declarer must win all three of these tricks, and take at least 66 card points. The contract is lost if any other player takes a trick - even the declarer\'s partner! Note also that in a Schnapser or Kontra-Schnapser, only the declarer can score for combination; if forehand\'s partner plays a Schnapser, there is no score for any K-Q combination held by forehand.\nScoring\nThe cumulative scores of the teams are recorded on a piece of paper (or a chalk slate) divided into two columns. When the declarer\'s contract is successful, the appropriate game points are added to the declarer\'s team\'s score. When it fails, the points are added to the other team\'s score. When a team\'s score reaches 24 or more game points, that team wins. This is recorded by marking a "Bummerl" (or Pummerl) - a blob in the losers\' column. If the losing team has no game points at all when the winners reach 24 they are "Schneider", and the winners win a double game, which is represented by two Bummerl for the losers.\nVariations\nSome circles do not allow the Bettler contract. When Bettler is allowed, there are several variations:\n\nSome play the the card order is changed; cards rank from high to low A-K-Q-J-10.\nSome play that Bettler is worth 5 game points rather than 4.\nSome play that the declarer\'s partner does not drop out, but all four players take part in the play.\nSome play that if either of forehand\'s opponents want to say Kontra to the normal game, this has priority over a Bettler. Even if forehand announces a Bettler, an opponent can Kontra the normal game, which annuls the Bettler and forces forehand to play a normal game with the chosen trump suit, unless someone wants to bid a higher contract, such as a Gang.\n\n\n\nSome include an additional contract "As-Bettler", which ranks just above an ordinary Bettler in the auction and is worth 5 game points. The As-Bettler is just like an ordinary Bettler, except that the declarer must hold at least one Ace. (The declarer could choose to bid Bettler instead, to conceal the ace.)\nSome circles do not allow the Zehner-Gang (Zehner-Ring or Zehner-Loch) contract. If allowed, it may be worth 8 or 9 game points rather than 10 and be ranked below an ordinary Gang.\nTalon-Schnapsen\nThe variation is for three players. In each deal the declarer plays against the other two players in temporary partnership. The general rules are the same as for Bauernschnapsen and the same 20 card pack is used.\nA batch of three cards is dealt to each player, then two face down to the centre of the table (the "Talon"), then another batch of three cards each. As in Bauernschnapsen, forehand must choose trumps on the basis of the first three cards dealt, or turn up a card for trumps from the second batch dealt to him. If the player to dealer\'s right knocks rather than cutting, forehand\'s two batches of three cards are dealt first, followed by a batch of 6 to each of the other players, and the 2-card talon is dealt last.\nThe possible contracts and the bidding procedure are the same as in Bauernschnapsen, with these exceptions:\n\nIn Schnapser and Kontra-Schnapser, declarer must win the first four tricks, and reach at least 66 card points in those four tricks\nIn Gang, Zehner-Gang, Bauern-Schnapser and Kontra-Bauern-Schnapser the declarer must win all six tricks\nIn Farben-Gang and Herren-Schnapser the declarer has a complete suit plus a sixth card. The declarer leads out the complete suit, winning five tricks, and must then win the sixth trick with the last card - which ideally would be an ace, but you could try playing this with a lower card and hope that the opponents keep the wrong cards.\n\n\n\nAfter the bidding, the declarer picks up the two talon cards without showing them, to make a hand of eight cards, and discards any two of these face down. The card points in the discarded cards do not count for either team. The players must agree in advance whether the declarer is allowed to change to a higher contract after seeing the talon.\nSome play that having won the bidding you can choose not to look at the talon, but to play with your original hand, and in this case the game is worth an extra game point.\nOther WWW pages and software\nYou can play Bauernschnapsen on line against live opponents at the Gametwist site (the interface is in German).\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Ace-Ten Games > Marriage Group > Bauernschnapsen\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2000, 2004.

It is a 4-player partnership game based on Tressette, but with the addition of a trump suit. This is a relatively recent development - we do not know of any reference to Beccaccino in print before 1971, when the word appeared in Libero Ercolani\'s Vocabolario romagnolo-italiano e italiano-romagnolo (Edizioni del Girasole, Ravenna). The game was known earlier by the name "tri sett cun el taj" ("Tressette with cutting", where "cutting" means using a trump to beat a non-trump). Nowadays it is known as Beccaccino near Faenza, as Marrafone near Forl, and other variants of the name such as Maraffone, Maraffa or Marafon are also found. The composite name was coined in Alteo Dolcini\'s book Il Pricipe di Romagna, Marafon-Beccaccino (Imola, 1975) which attempts to lay down official rules for the game.\nTwo other games related to the Marafon-Beccaccino are also played in Romagna. Trionfo is a 5-player variation, which inspired the book Il Bedgo  by Nevio Manaresi (Imola, 1991). It is described below. Mattazza or Matta, is a Tressette-like game in which the aim is to avoid taking tricks. It is thus similar to Traversone or Rovescino and is described on the page for those games.\nPlayers and Cards\nMarafon-Beccacino is a partnership point-trick game for four players. Partners sit facing each other. Like most Italian card games, this game is played anti-clockwise. \nA 40-card Latin suited pack of the Romagnole pattern is used.  The suits are coins, cups, swords and clubs and the cards of each suit rank from high to low: 3, 2, Ace, King, Horse, Jack, 7, 6, 5, 4. The aim is to take valuable cards in tricks, the values being as follows:\n\nEach ace . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . one whole point\nEach 3, 2, King, Horse, Jack . .one third of a point\nThe last trick . . . . . . . . . . . . . . one whole point\n\nThese card ranks and values are the same as in Tressette.\n\nThe lowest four cards in a suit - 7, 6, 5, 4 - are known as scartine. They are worth nothing. \nThe picture cards King (Re), Horse (Cavallo) and Jack (Fante) are called figure.\nThe highest three cards - the 3, 2 and Ace - are called cricche (each of them is a cricca).\n\nThe Deal and Making Trumps\nThe dealer shuffles and the player to dealer\'s left cuts. 10 cards are dealt to each player, anticlockwise, in batches of five at a time.\nAfter the deal, one of the players chooses and announces the trump suit for the hand. This player is called the "battezzante" because he names (baptises) the trump suit. A complete hand of 10 tricks is called a "battezzata".\nFor the very first deal of a session, the battezzante is the player who was dealt the 4 of coins. In the second and subsequent deals, the battezzante is the player to dealer\'s right. The battezzante in each hand deals the following hand, so after the second deal, the turn to deal passes to the right.\nThe choice of trumps must be made without any discussion or signalling between partners. For this reason, in the second and subsequent deals, the partner of the "battezzante", the player to dealer\'s left, is not allowed to look at his own cards before the trump announcement has been made.\nThe Play\nThe battezzante leads to the first trick. Any card may be led, and the other players must play in turn a card of the suit led ("andare liscio") if they have one. A player with no card of the suit led may eitherplay  a trump ("tagliare") or discard a card of another non-trump suit. The highest card of the suit led wins the trick unless a trump has been played, in which case, the highest trump wins. The winner of each trick leads to the next trick.\nA player who holds the highest three trumps - 3, 2 and Ace - can declare them during the first trick for a score of 3 extra points for the player\'s team. This combination is known as "marafona", "cricca", "maraffa" or sometimes "napoletana".\nWhen leading to a trick, you may make one of the following announcements:\n\n"Busso" means that you want your partner to play his highest card in the suit you led, and if this wins the trick, to lead the suit back. "Busso" can also be announced by knocking on the table (or on the led card). \n"Volo" means that you have no further cards of the suit led. "Volo" can be also announced by  throwing the led card so that it flies through the air and lands gently on the table. \n"Striscio" means that you have, in addition to the card you are leading, one or more low cards (king or lower) of the suit led. "Striscio" can also be announced by sliding the card you are leading onto the table.\n\nPlayers are not allowed to make more than one announcement in the same trick. Misleading the other players by making false announcements is not illegal, though it is usually unwise.\nThe Scoring\nOnce all 10 tricks have been played each side scores the total value of all cards it has won in tricks. As mentioned above, the side that wins the last trick gets 1 additional point. The total points available (including the one for last trick) amount to eleven and two thirds, but fractions are disregarded. So the total points scored on each deal (apart from points for "marafona" are actually 11 (two thirds of a point being thrown away). For example if one side scores 7 and one third points, their score is actually 7, while the other side scores 4. \nThe partnership which first reaches 41 points wins the game. This will normally take several deals. Usually 2 games (the brutte) are played; in case of a tie, a third game, la bella, is then played to decide the result of the match.\nA player can stop the play at any point and claim that his side has reached 41 points with the tricks already won up to that point plus the points for any marafona declared. Players are not allowed to look at previous tricks, so they need to keep a mental running total of their score. If the claim is correct the claiming side wins (irrespective of the other side\'s total); if it is incorrect, the claiming side loses. The possibility of claiming affects the strategy of the game when the scores are close to 41.\nA side that does not make any points in a battezzata is said to be cappotto, but there is no special score for this. The winners simply score 11 points (or 14 if they declared a marafona).\nVariations\nSome play to 31 points instead of 41. Many play two games to 31 and the third deciding game - "la bella" - to 41 if needed.\nSome play that a side that claims need at least 31 and 1/3 points to win; 31 points are not enough, and the 3 points for "cricca" or "marafon" do not count when claiming.\nThere are some variations in the declaration of a cricca or marafona.\n\nSome limit the declaration of marafona to the battezzante only. Others allow any of the four players to declare it if they are lucky enough to hold the top three trumps.\nSome play that in order to declare marafona, the battezzante must begin by leading the ace of trumps.\n\nSome allow two further announcements when leading to a trick: \n\n"Fuori tutto", when the card led is a trump and none of the top three (3, 2, A) has yet been played, means that the player has none of these top three trumps - they are "all out". \n"Taglia", when leading a non-trump, invites partner to play a trump to win the trick.\n\nSome play that if the battezzante is dealt 10 cards that are worth in total less than one point and one figura (i.e. less than one and one third points) he is allowed to "mandare a monte": the deal is abandoned and the cards are redealt by the same dealer.\nSome expressions derived from Tressette are used to describe certain strong card combinations. These are not allowed as "declarations" during the game - they are terms that are sometimes used in discussion after a game:\n\n"Venticinque" (twenty-five) means the 3 and 2 of a suit. \n"Ventotto" (twenty-eight) means the 2 and Ace of a suit. \n"Ventinove" (Twenty-nine) means the 3 and Ace of a suit.\n\nThese numbers are based on the card values in the old game Primiera, in which the 3 counts thirteen, the 2 counts twelve and the Ace counts sixteen. Each of these two-card combinations, when accompanied by one more card of the same suit is described as "terzo", with 2 more cards "quarto", etc. For example the "ventinove quinto" (28 fifth) is the 3, Ace and three more cards of the same suit. This is similar to the English terminology used in for example Bridge, where one might say "I had the King to three" or "King third" or "King three times" meaning the King and two others of a suit.\nTrionfo\nTrionfo, also known as Trionfino is for 5 players with variable partnerships. In each deal the players bid for the right to choose the trump suit. The lowest bid also allows the bidder to call a partner so that there are two teams, 2 players against 3; the higher bids require the bidder to play alone against a team of 4.\nThe deal\nEight cards are dealt to each player, in batches of four. In the first deal of a session, the player who receives the 5 of swords speaks first in the bidding. This player also deals the second hand. From the second hand onwards, the player to dealer\'s right speaks first in the bidding and the turn to deal passes to the right.\nThe bidding, making trumps and calling\nThere are four possible bids. In ascending order they are "chiamo" (I call), "di pi" (more), "maso" (most) and "maso dei masi" (most of all). A player who does not wish to bid can pass (passo). The players speak in anticlockwise order, starting with the player to the dealer\'s right (in the very first deal the holder of the 5 of swords starts). The final and highest bidder is the declarer and will choose the trump suit. If all players pass, the hand "va a monte" - i.e. it is abandoned and there is a new deal by the next dealer.\nIf the only bid was a call, the declarer (the chiamante or signore) both decides on the trump suit (briscola) and names a card of a different suit (usually a 3) whose holder will be his partner (amico) for that hand. For example he might say "I call the 3 of cups; coins are trump", and whoever holds the 3 of cups becomes his partner. The partner must not do or say anything to reveal who he is until the called card is played. It is legal to call a card that is in your own hand (chiamata in mano): in that case you have no partner and all the other four players form a team against you, though they will not realise this at first. The chiamante and his partner (the signore and his amico) are called the ricchi or signori (the rich, the nobles) while the players of the other team are i poveri or il popolo (the poor, the crowd).\nIf the final bid is "di pi", the bidder names the trump suit and plays alone, the other four players forming a team (il popolo). As in an ordinary call, the bidder\'s objective is to take more card points than the opponents.\nIf the final bid is "maso", the declarer names the trump suit and in order to succeed, must take 6 card points in tricks before the opponents take a card point.\nIf the final bid is "maso dei masi" the declarer names the trump suit and must win every trick to succeed.\nThe play\nIrrespective of who bid and how high, it is the player who began the bidding (the player to dealer\'s right or in the first deal the holder of the 5 of swords) who leads to the first trick. No declaration of marafona or cricca is allowed, so there are always just 11 points in the game. As in Marafon-Beccaccino, players must follow suit if they can; if not they may play any card. The highest trump, or if none are played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nScoring\nIn this game, the players settle up after each deal in game points (or in money). These game points are entirely separate from the card points, which are used only to determine which side has won.\nAt the end of the play, the cards taken by each team are counted. If the bid was a call or "di pi", the side with more card points (i.e. at least 6 card points) wins. If the bidder called a partner and the signori win, the signore receives 2 game points, the amico receives 1 game point, and each player of the popolo pays 1 game point. If the popolo wins, the signore pays 2 game points, the amico pays 1 game point and each player of the popolo receives 1 game point.\nIn case of chiamata in mano (where the bidder calls his own card), or a bid of "di pi" the payments are doubled: the declarer wins or loses 8 game points and each member of the crowd wins or loses 2.\nIf the bid was "di maso" the declarer receives 16 game points if he succeeds in taking 6 card points before the opponents take as much as 1 whole card point, and pays 16 game points otherwise. Each member of the popolo wins or loses 4 game points.\nFor a bid of "maso dei masi", the declarer wins 32 game points if he takes every trick, each member of the popolo paying 8. If he loses a trick, the declarer pays 8 game points to each member of the popolo, 32 points in all.\nOther Web Pages\nThe Trionfo page at Splash.it has brief rules in Italian for the partnership game Marafon-Beccaccino. The name Trionfo has been used for many different games with trumps, from the XV century onwards. The XVI-century Trionfo game referred to at the top of the page was not this game but a plain-trick game with 5 cards dealt to each player.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Tressette group > Marafon - Beccaccino\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2008.

Mike Block learnt it as Clobyosh in his childhood, thinking of it then as a peculiarly Jewish game, but was amazed to discover it being played - in the early 1980\'s - in a pub in Central Scotland (The Quarry Inn in Twechar to be precise). He subsequently found out that Bela (as it is called in that part of the world) is well known in mining communities in Scotland and also in the prisons (there is a unique four-handed variation called \'Barlinnie Rules\'!). No one could tell him reliably how it appeared on the scene. An older player thought it had been introduced by a Jewish hairdresser in Kirkintilloch in the late 1930s - as good an explanation as any. The appearance of Belote (closely similar, but with some subtle differences) in France is equally explosive: a Petit Larousse dated 1925 has no mention of Belote; a later edition (1938) describes it as \'un jeu de cartes Etrangre\'; and a booklet of rules - La Belotte by G Huitte, published in Paris in 1925 - implies that it was recently introduced. Belote is now the most popular card game in France and has been since before the Second World War: no doubt the French, too, think it peculiarly their own.\n\nTwo-handed Bela.\nThe Pack.\n\nA thirty-two card pack is used, the cards 2-6 being removed. (This is a pretty standard pack for France - or indeed Germany, where Skat is played with thirty-two cards - and is sold as a pack for Piquet/Belote/Manille). \n\nThe Aim.\n\nAlthough Bela is a trick taking game, the winner of a hand is not neccessarily the winner of the most tricks. Each card has a point value, and points are counted for combinations held in the hand before it is played. One particular combination is declared as it is played - the K-Q of the trump suit (called Bela) - and points are also scored for making the last trick. Each player aims to score more points in cards captured during a hand of play and in combinations than his opponent. A complete game takes several hands and is won by the player whose score first reaches or passes a total of 501.\n\nThe Values of the Cards.\n\nIn general, the Ace is worth 11 points, the Ten is worth 10, with King, Queen, Jack being worth 4, 3, 2 respectively. The other cards are worth nothing - although they may still have their uses in play. In the trump suit, the values change with very important consequences for the judgement of a hand. In trump, the jack - called Yuss - is the highest card, worth 20 points. Next highest card is the normally worthless Nine - called Manel - now worth 14 points. Thereafter the trumps follow the values applied to non-trump cards - A=11, Ten=10, K=4, Q=3, Eight and Seven=0.\n\nCombinations.\n\nCombinations held in hand at the start of play are worth:\n\nRun of four in the same suit: 50\nRun of three in the same suit: 20\nCards rank in their \'natural\' order - A-K-Q-J is a \'fifty\', but A-Ten-K-Q is not.\n  (These must be declared and shown during the play of the first trick if they are to count - it is also necessary for the holder to make a trick during the hand of play.)\n\nBela (K-Q of trump): 20\nBela is declared as it is played. On playing the first card of the K-Q in trump a player says \'Bela\'; on playing the second \'from the Bela\'. This parallels the French \'Belote\' and \'Rebelote\'. In Scotland it is acceptable to make the declaration of Bela only on the second card.\n\nThere are no other valid combinations - nothing extra for holding a run of five, nor for holding four-of-a-kind as in French Belote.\nIt is not obligatory to declare combinations (when, of course, they may not be counted to one\'s final total) - indeed there are circumstances when one deliberately does not make the declaration.\n\nTricks.\n\nA suit led must be followed if posible. If the suit cannot be followed, then it is obligatory to trump - an important feature of tactical play. When a trump is led, it is obligatory to beat the trump played - another important, tactical consideration. But it is acceptable in Scotland to withold the Yuss (trump J) if one holds the Yuss alone (bare Yuss). Only if one can neither follow suit nor play a trump is it permitted to discard freely. The trick-taking power of a card is determined by its point value - thus A takes Ten, takes K, takes Q, takes J, takes Nine, takes Eight, takes Seven in non-trump suits; and J takes Nine, takes A, etc in trump - and trumps take cards of any other suit (a trump Seven will take an Ace of Hearts - old Scots/Jewish proverb).\n\nThe Deal.\n\nPlayers cut for deal, the higher dealing for the first hand. Here the ranking of cards is the \'natural\' A K Q J 10 9 8 7 - which applies also to combinations. Given two equal cards of different suits there is a fresh cut for deal. On subsequent deals it is the winner of the last hand who deals for the next - this is fair, since non-dealer (forehand) - has a distinct advantage. Dealer offers the pack for his opponent to cut (it is slightly bad form in a friendly game actually to cut the pack - a tap on the top of the pack is the \'correct\' gesture unless honour is at stake or mockery intended), gives three cards face down to his opponent, then three to himself, then another three to his opponent, then another three to himself. The top card of the undealt stack is turned over for a proposed trump suit and placed face up, partially covered, under the stack. Non-dealer (forehand) assesses the likely value of his hand and decides whether to accept the suit of the turn-up as trump for the hand. Should he accept the trump, he says \'I take\' and commits himself to beating his opponent on that hand of play - the consequences of failure can sometimes be disastrous! If he declines the first trump - \'I pass\' - it is then dealer\'s turn to take or decline the turn-up suit as trump. If dealer also passes, forehand has a free choice of trump suit (\'I take in xxxx\' - naming the suit) - a considerable advantage - but may not now call the turn-up suit. And should forehand decline to name a suit - \'I pass again\' - dealer now has a free choice of suit under the same constraint or may also \'Pass again\'.\n\nIf neither player accepts or names a trump suit, there is a fresh deal by the original forehand. The deal can alternate between the two players several times - especially at a critical phase of the game - with neither player willing to take the risk of accepting or choosing a trump.\nBut once a trump is chosen, dealer gives three more cards to forehand to take into his hand and three more to himself. Each player will have evaluated their hand on the basis of six cards out of a final nine - this is the moment of truth. Don\'t expect too much of the last three cards: they can make an already promising hand, or break a mediocre one. The bottom card of the stack is then taken out and turned over for both to see (a little extra information - in two-handed play there would otherwise be 13 hidden cards) and placed on top of the stack. \n\nThe Exchange.\n\nOnce the full deal is complete, and if the turn-up suit has been accepted as trump, either player holding the Seven of that trump suit may exchange it for the original turn-up - this can lead to some nasty or pleasant surprises depending on your point of view. But no exchange is allowed if a different suit becomes trump.\n\nPlay and Declarations.\n\nForehand leads to the first trick. As he does so, he declares any combination he may hold by saying \'I have a fifty/twenty\'. Dealer plays his first card saying \'Good\' if he cannot better that combination; \'I have (a fifty/twenty)\' if he holds a combination of the same value; or \'Not good - I have a fifty\' if forehand declared a twenty when he himself has a fifty. Only one player will be able to count their combination towards the final point count for their hand - the holder of the best combination (a player may have more than one combination in hand, and may be able to count both of them). If both players have combinations of equal value, forehand then says \'Mine is * high\' naming the highest card of his sequence (\'natural\' order again). Dealer replies \'Good\' if his highest card in the sequence is lower; \'Not good - mine is ** high\' if it is better; or \'I have also\' if the leading card is of the same rank. Forehand then says \'Mine is in ***\' naming the suit. If that suit is trump, his combination takes precedence (he will have said \'Mine is in trump\' in that case) and will otherwise take precedence unless dealer\'s sequence is in trump. Dealer at this point does not indicate the suit - simply saying \'Good\' if his is not in trump, or \'Not good\' if it is.\nThis may seem over elaborate. But the idea is to establish precedence without giving too much away - the score for a sequence (which often swings a hand) is gained in exchange for information and it would be unfair for the holder of a losing combination to have to reveal his hand  unnecessarily. The winning sequence is displayed for verification as the second trick is played. A second, inferior sequence - which will not have entered into discussion until this point - held in the same hand must be shown if it is to score. Thus a player with a King-high fifty and a Nine-high twenty will score 70 for combinations against a player with an Ace-high twenty.\nThe rest of the tricks are then played out: winner of the last trick leads to the next.\nAs an added complication, no sequence can be counted until its holder has actually made a trick. An Ace-high fifty in a non-trump suit will count for nothing (in trump it will contain the Yuss so must make a trick or three) unless a trick - however mean or otherwise worthless (it could be an Eight taking a Seven) is made. Believe me - this happens!\n\'Bela\' is declared as the first card of the K-Q of trump is played, either as the first or second card to a trick, and \'from the Bela\' as the second card is played. Bela is an absolute combination - it can always count regardless of any other sequences either player may hold.\n\nIt is customary in the Scottish circles in which Mike Block has played that any trump lead must be with a scoring card (Yuss Manel A Ten K Q), not an Eight or a Seven - there is a certain sense of fair play in this.\n\nLast Trick.\n\nThe player taking the last trick with whatever card counts 10 points - it is often a good idea to try to keep a winning card for last (or Shtoch to a Clobyosh player), although hardly an overriding consideration.\n\nThe Score.\nThe defending player who did not accept or choose the trump counts his points first - his points are always good. He begins with his combinations - fifty, twenty, Bela as appropriate - then last trick; then adds the point value of the cards he has taken in tricks, starting with Yuss and/or Manel if he has them; then counting the rest one by one. His opponent then does the same - but his points are only good if his score on the hand is the better. \nShould the trump chooser lose the hand, his points are counted to his opponent - that\'s what I meant by disastrous earlier on - it is called going/being bate. (Mike Block wrote: "It sounds the same in Yiddish or Scots - I have doubts about the etymology - maybe the Scots are descended from one of the ten lost tribes?" In fact \'bate\' is derived from the French bte = beast, a term found in many card games.)\nAn over optimistic take may be shattered on picking up the last three cards, or on the first trick when declarations are settled, or on the early run of play - a good player (we all make mistakes) will decide at this point not to declare the Bela that he holds lest 20 points fall to his opponent.\n\nIt happens sometimes that scores are equal. This is not a problem in modern versions of Belote: you said you would win; you didn\'t; tough - my score! But in Bela/Clobyosh and also older versions of Belote the disputed score is held in abeyance until the next played out hand - whoever wins that next hand gains the score held over - so the original taker still has a chance of redemption. (The deal in this case simply alternates since there is deemed to have been no winner.)\nThe scores are simply totted up on a scrap of paper. They tend to look something like this (aside from the comments):\n\n\n\n M     Y\n---   ---\n 56    23 (a slightly chancy win for M)\n 38   106 (Y had fifty, Ace-bela - why didn\'t I deal myself this?)\n---   ---\n 94   128 (early days, yet, not much in it.)\n 88    84 (another chancy win for M)\n---   ---\n182   212\n 80\n 64       (Y took with Yuss Manel, went bate as I had a fifty)\n---   ---\n326   212 (this begins to feel like a comfortable lead)\netc\nWinning the Game.\n\nThe game is played to a total of 501. The first player to reach or pass that total wins. Note that if you reach 501 points through declarations and tricks won to date in the middle of the play you win, even if you were the trump maker, and would have lost if the hand had been played out to the end. In this case it does not matter whether the trump maker can win more points than the opponent. You can even use the 10 points for the last trick to claim the game if they take you to 501 or over. The count of points and transfer of points to the opponent if the trump maker has not won occurs only if neither player has been able to claim 501 as a result of points won for declarations, tricks and last trick.\nSuppose, for example, Y has 478 to M\'s 495, but is forehand (therefore first lead) holding a possible twenty (Nine-high!?) and J of the turn-up he should take on in the turn-up suit, play his Yuss for 20 and declare his twenty for another 20 points in the (reasonable) hope dealer cannot better it. His 40 points take him beyond 501 before his opponent has scored - he wins then and there whatever the outcome of the fully played out hand might have been. And if M did hold a fifty or even a better twenty, he still gets to 498 before his opponent (who cannot count his combination until he has made a trick) has scored. Y has the small problem of pulling out a winning lead to give the needed 3 points (or 2 points if he were playing Clobyosh against my father, who like many Clobyosh players regarded 500 as the score to be reached or passed for a win.). And if he can\'t find the right card he can console himself with the thought that he would have lost anyway - better to go down fighting.\nIt is important to claim the win as soon as 501 is reached or passed - otherwise one\'s opponent is still in with a chance. One could be sitting on 506, say, yet loose the game to an opponent who sneaks in with 501 but is smart enough to make the claim. Also, if at the end of a hand one\'s score has passed 501 without game being claimed, one has to make a trick (any trick will do) to consummate the win (at least in Scottish circles) before one\'s opponent can lawfully claim game. A falsely of claimed game forfeits the game.\nNormally best-of-three is played, the winner of the last game dealing for the first hand of the next.\n\nAdvice.\n\nEnjoy learning the game - so not much advice. It pays to be a little aggressive and sometimes unpredictable. Push the game along. Don\'t be mechanical in your assessment of your hand - it isn\'t always necessary to hold Yuss-Manel of a potential trump (although it\'s a good, 34-point start). But you do nearly always need some kind of a backing hand - some good scoring cards in non-trump suits - to get away with it. And when you are well ahead or way behind, be outrageous - what\'s to lose? Don\'t be one of those boring players who will only take on a 24-carat, nuclear-bomb-proof hand. Games are won as much in defence as in attack, though - so play for the most you can make when forced to defend with a poor hand, even against seemingly overwhelming strength.\nVariations\nSchmeiss\n\nThis variation is mentioned in most printed descriptions of Clobiosh.\n\n\nIf you play this way, then the players have a third option at their first turn to speak: instead of saying Pass or Take, they can say Schmeiss (from the German schmeissen: to throw away). Schmeiss is a proposal to abandon the deal. If the opponent of the player who says Schmeiss agrees, the cards are thrown in and the previous non-dealer deals (there is no opportunity to choose a different trump suit in this case). Instead the opponent of the Schmeisser can insist on playing, in which case the player who said Schmeiss becomes the taker, exactly as though he had chosen the suit of the turned-up card as trumps.\n\nEqual scores\nAccording to some books, if the players\' scores are equal, the bidder scores nothing and the opponent scores just the points that he took, not the total.\n\n\nLast Hand and Winning\nMany play to a target score of 500 rather than 501.\nMost books give a version of the rules in which the last hand is played out to the end. It is not possible to claim a win if you reach the target score during the play. If at the end of a hand both players have reached 501 (or 500) the player with the higher score wins. If they are equal, presumably another deal is played.\nMike Block reports that a friend from East Lothian plays a variant in which the game gan only be claimed by a player who reaches 501 or more within the first three tricks. Otherwise the hand has to be played out, and the scoring carried through, with the usual consequences if the trump maker fails to win more points than the opponent.\nThree-handed Bela.\n\nAll the basics are the same. It is a better game for two related reasons:\nthere are fewer hidden cards (three as against twelve when turn-up and bottom card are included)there is far less likely to be an endless alternation of deals because no one has the nerve to take\nIt also allows the possibilities of temporary and completely unprincipled conspiracy between the two defending players. Mike Block came across this version in Scotland and says there is a touch of \'Ah kent his faither\' about it, where you have it in for someone who might just be getting above himself. \n\nDealer deals clockwise in threes to each player. Players speak in turn clockwise. The taker simply has to gain more than either opponent, not to beat their combined score. In the case of a bate the higher opponent wins the bate player\'s points. \n\nFor the sake of clarity, it is worth pointing out that where a lead of a plain suit has been trumped by the second player to a trick and the third to play also has no cards in the suit led, then the third player must still overtrump if possible. If he cannot overtrump he must play a lower trump, and only if he is out of trump may he discard freely. \n\nIt is usual to \'Gie it to the low man\' when it comes to discarding - second best in the running total of points will often throw a good card onto third best\'s certain trick to stop it falling to the \'high man\'. (The \'high man\' will sometimes do this, too, to keep his nearest rival, the \'middle man\', out.) Whether this is more fair play, \'Ah kent his faither\', or guid (sic) sense, is for you to judge - it generally makes for a better game. \nSoftware\nDeberc  - a Ukrainian game almost identical to Bela and Clobyosh - can be played online at meingames.de.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Ace-Ten Games > Marriage Group > Jass group > Bela / Clobyosh\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1995, 2001, 2004.

It is a close relative of Clobyosh (also known as Bela), which is played in Jewish communities in many parts of the world, and of the Dutch game Klaverjassen.\n\nBelote is a point-trick taking game for 2, 3, or 4 players. Its most interesting form is the 4 player version, which is described first.  \n\nA 32 card deck is needed ( A K Q J 10 9 8 7).\n\nCard point values\n   \nCards in the trump suit both rank and score differently from those in other suits.\nNotice the promotion of the trump 9 and J.\n\n\n\nTrump suitOther suits\nJ20A11\n9141010\nA11K4\n1010Q3\nK4J2\nQ390\n8080\n7070\n\n\nBelote for four players\n\nPlayers form two teams of two partners. Partners sit at opposite seats. The direction of deal, bidding and play is anti-clockwise.\n \nThe deal and the bidding\n\nThe pack is never shuffled at Belote. The player before the dealer in rotation (i.e. the player to dealer\'s left) cuts the pack.  The dealer gives a set of three cards to each player, then another set of two cards, and turns the next card face up.    \n\nThe player after the dealer in rotation (the player to dealer\'s right) can now "take", i.e. choose the turn-up card suit as a trump, or pass. If this player passes, the next player can take or pass, and so on around the table. If all 4 players pass, each in turn has a second chance to take, choosing a trump suit other than that of the face up card. If all players pass a second time, the cards are collected together and the next player in rotation deals. \n\nAs soon as a player takes (in the first or second round of bidding), the bidding ends. The taker is given the turn-up card (whether it is a trump or not) and the deal resumes. Each player except the taker is dealt a further packet of three cards, and the taker is dealt only two cards. These cards are dealt in rotation, beginning to dealer\'s right and ending with the dealer. \n\nDeclarations\n\nDeclarations are particular sets of cards held in players\' hands, which give players extra points. There are three sorts of declarations: \n\n4 cards of the same rank, called "carr" in French, or "square"\n\n4 jacks: 200 points\n  4 nines: 150  points\n  4 Aces, tens, Ks, Qs: 100 points\n\n4 eights and 4 sevens are not counted. \n\nSequences from 3 to 5 cards of the same suit. There is yet another ranking of cards for sequences, by descending order: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7\n\n3 cards: 20 points\n  4 cards: 50 points\n  5 cards: 100 points\n\nSequences longer than 5 cards are declared and counted as any of the 5-card sequences which they include. \n\nBelote and Rebelote are the trump King and Queen held together in one player\'s hand, and are counted 20 points. \n\nRanking of the declarations: \n\nBelote-Rebelote always scores 20 points, irrespective of other declarations.\n\nApart from Belote-Rebelote, only the team holding the highest declaration is entitled to count its declarations. The other team scores nothing even if it holds several inferior declarations giving a point total higher than the highest declaration. \n\nA square is higher than a 5 card sequence. Between equally long sequences, the one containing the higher ranked cards wins. If there are two sequences of equal rank, and one is trumps, the trump sequence wins. If none is trump, the one held by the player who is earliest in rotation wins (playing anticlockwise, the player to dealer\'s right is first in rotation and the dealer is last). A particular card may not be involved in two declarations (except in Belote-Rebelote).   \n\nWhen to declare, apart from Belote-Rebelote:\n\nThe traditional method, now increasingly ignored (see variations below) is the following: \n\nEach player makes his declaration(s) at the moment he plays his card during the first trick, saying "4 kings", "sequence of 4", etc. \n  The first trick is collected. \n  If necessary there is a contention to find out the winning declaration. All declarations made by the side with the winning declaration are scored.\n  A player of the other team may ask to see the cards of the declaration(s) which were scored.  These must then be shown. Of course if a card involved in the declaration has been played in the first trick the opponents will remember. \n\nIf the highest sequence announced by each side is equal, the first announcer in rotation specifies the highest card of the sequence, and the next announcer either specifies his highest card if it beats the opponent\'s, or says "good!" if it does not. If the heights are the same, the player who holds a trump sequence specifies it. \n  \n\nWhen to declare Belote-Rebelote:\n   \nA player who holds the king and queen of trumps declares "Belote" when playing the first of these card and "Rebelote" when playing the second.\n  \nThe Play\n\nThe next player in rotation after the dealer (the player to dealer\'s right) leads a card. The subsequent players must follow suit if they can. If the card led is trump, subsequent players must not only follow suit, but also play a trump card that beats all previous cards if they can, whoever holds the trick at this stage.  \n\n\nTrumping: If a player is unable to follow to a non-trump suit, and an opponent is currently winning the trick, he must trump if he can, otherwise he may discard any card. If his partner is currently winning the  trick he is free to either trump, or discard any card. \n\nOvertrumping and undertrumping: If a player is the third or the fourth to play, and is unable to follow a non-trump suit, and the opponent just before him has trumped, he must overtrump if he can. If he has trumps but is unable to overtrump, he must still play a trump, although he does not benefit from doing so. This is termed "undertrumping", or "pisser" in French Belote jargon.  \n\nIf   the fourth  player is unable to follow suit to a plain suit lead which his partner has already trumped, and his partner is winning the trick (because the third player  either discarded or undertrumped),  the fourth player may either discard (even if he holds trump) or overtrump. If he is unable to overtrump, having no sufficiently high trumps, he may either discard or undertrump.\n\nTo summarize these rules, you must always follow suit, if unable to follow you must trump unless your partner is winning the trick (in French: le partenaire est matre), and whenever playing a trump you must beat the highest trump in the trick if possible. \n\nAs in most trick-taking games, the player who won the trick has the lead to the next one. \n\nThe last trick counts 10 points for the team who wins it. This is called "Dix de Der" in French; "Der" is a shortening of Dernier, the last. The point total including these 10 is 162 points. \n\nScoring\n    \nThe tricks taken by each team are added to the team\'s scoring declarations. (Remember that, apart from Belote-Rebelote, only one team can score for declarations).\n\nIf the team who "took" wins at least as many points as the other team, the taking team has made its contract, and both teams add their scores into their column. If the taker\'s team\'s points are less than those of the opponents, the takers are "dedans" (inside), and the opponents score 162 points plus the losing team\'s declarations, if any, plus their own declarations.  \n\nIf the team who took wins all the tricks, that team scores 100 points instead of the Dix de Der, giving a total of 252 points plus declarations. This situation is called "Capot" in French ( "tre capot" for the victims, "mettre capot" for the winners). The team which took no tricks forfeit their own declarations other than Belote-Rebelote, if any. In some exceptional cases it turns out that the team who took wins no tricks at all. Despite the likely derision in this case the other team wins only the regular 252 points, plus all the declarations of both teams. \n\nThe winning team is the first to reach a total of 1000 points.  If both sides reach 1000 points on the same hand, the game is drawn.\nVariations\n\nDirection of play\nPeople often play the whole game clockwise, rather than anticlockwise. \nDeal\nSome play that the dealer is free to either follow the dealing scheme described above, or deal the sets of 2 cards first.\nDeclarations\nEtiquette: nowadays most players will make their declarations and show them as soon as they notice them in their hand.\nPlayers can agree to play without declarations. This reduces the luck element of the game. In tournaments, declarations other than Belote-Rebelote are not counted.\nSome play that when playing the King and Queen which form a Belote-Rebelote, the King must be played first. \nCriteria for winning the contract\nSome do not include the declarations in the point total when determining whether the takers made their contract. In this case, making one\'s contract means obtaining at least 81 points, without regard to the declarations. \nSome demand that in order to make the contract, the taker\'s team must have more points than the opponents. In case of equality, the taker\'s team loses and the opponents get all the points.\nWhen both teams get the same amount of points, some play that the result is undecided, and the points from this deal are held in abeyance. On the next deal, if the previous taker\'s team makes a contract or causes the other team\'s contract to fail its contract, then each team gets the equal number of points from the tied deal added to its score. If the previous taker\'s team loses its contract, or their opponents make a contract, the whole 162 points + declarations held in abeyance are given the opponents of the taker from the tied deal. \n\nSome play that when the points are equal, only the bidders\' opponents score their points. The bidders\' points are held in abeyance and added to the winning team\'s score in the next deal. This process is sometimes known as "litige".\nRules of play\nSome players (probably influenced by Tarot) use a different rule for undertrumping. The fourth to play after a non-trump card has been trumped by his partner, when unable to either follow suit or overtrump, must undertrump even if his partner holds the trick. So in this variation, if the trick has already been trumped by your partner and you also have no cards of the suit led, then:\n\nif you are able to overtrump, you may either do so or you may throw away from another suit, but you are not allowed to undertrump;\nif you have trumps but are unable to overtrump, you must undertrump if you can - you cannot throw away another suit;\nif have no trumps, then of course you must throw away another suit.\n\nIn French, this curious variation is is described by the phrase: "On est toujours oblig de pisser". The regular rule is: "On ne pisse pas sur le partenaire".\nScoring\nAnother probable influence of Tarot is rounding up scores to the closest multiple of 5 or 10, to make point adding faster. \nSome people play that a defending team which is capot (takes no tricks) still scores their declarations. If this variation is played, it is possible that the defending team scores more than the takers, even without making a trick. It is generally agreed that in this case the takers are not dedans; both teams score their points. The defenders have to take at least one trick to put the takers dedans.\nEnding the game: L\'Arrt\nIf you have just won just won a trick and you think that your team already has the necessary 1000 points to win the game, including any declarations and the tricks you have won so far, you can stop the game. The points in the tricks played so far are counted and if you really do have at least 1000 you win, no matter how many points the other team has. If you are wrong and you have less than 1000 points, the other team wins - even if they had no chance of getting to 1000 had play continued. \nIf you stop the game when you are on the taker\'s side, you also have to continue playing the hand to demonstrate that you can take at least as many points as the opponents on that hand, otherwise you will not be allowed to count any points from the current hand towards your 1000 and your side loses the game.\nNote: It is not permitted to look back into previous tricks to count their points when deciding whether to stop the game - you have to remember the points you have taken.\n\nBelote Dcouverte\n\nMost regular Belote players are reluctant to play it with a number of players other than four, but here is an interesting variation for 2 players: "Belote with exposed cards" (Belote Dcouverte).  \n\nThe Deal\n\nA 32-card deck is used. \n\nThe dealer mentally draws a border-line at the middle of the table between himself and his opponent, and deals:\n\n4 face-down cards in a row, close to this line, in the opponent\'s camp.\n  4 face-down cards close to the line in his own camp\n  4 face-down cards adjacent to the first series in the opponent\'s camp.\n  4 face-down cards adjacent to the second series in his own camp.\n\nHe then repeats exactly the same scheme covering each face-down card with a face-up card. \n\n\nThe Bidding\n\nThe last card that was dealt in the dealer\'s camp indicates the trump suit at the first round of bidding. If necessary there is second round of bidding, exactly as in Belote. The taker does not, however, take the card indicating the trump suit. It continues to belong to the dealer.\n\nThe Play\n\nThe non-dealer chooses one of his face-up cards, puts it on the side of the table to initiate the first trick. The dealer chooses one of his face-up cards, according to regular Belote rules regarding following suit, trumping,\nbeating a trump card, and discarding. The trick is taken by either player according to Belote rules. Then both players turn the face-down cards which were underneath the played cards face-up. In the following tricks, players may play either a face-up card that still covers a face-down card, or an isolated face-up card from the previous tricks. At the end of each trick, any face-down card which is no longer covered by a face-up card is turned face-up. As in Belote, the winner of each trick has the lead to the next one. The play continues until the 16 tricks have been played. \n\nThe Score\n\nCard point values are the same as in Belote, but declarations and Belote-Rebelote do not count. The cards taken by each player are scored as in Belote. (You are reminded that the point total including the 10 for the last trick is 162, so you need count only the smaller heap.) As in Belote, the taker loses if he gets 81 points or fewer. \n\nVariations\n\nSome play that the player who leads to a trick turns his corresponding face-down card up immediately.  This often affects the other player\'s choice.\n\nIt must be agreed whether to count the Belote-Rebelote, and the other declarations. \n\nSome Belote variations like No-Trumps, All-Trumps, or even La Coinche can be adapted. Games similar to Belote lend themselves to this variation.\n\nOther Belote WWW pages and software\nThe Fdration Franaise de Belote was established in 2013 to promote the game and organise tournaments.\nAt GameDuell you can play Belote online against live opponents.\nBelote is also popular in Bulgaria.

There is a huge number of variations of this game, differing between regions of France and between  groups of players. These variations affect every part of the game: the deal, the bidding, the play and the scoring. On this page a basic form of the La Coinche will be described first, followed by a selection of common variations, and some references to sources where further variations can be found.\nBelote belongs to the Jass family of games, which originated in the Netherlands in the early 18th century or earlier. They spread across Europe, reaching Switzerland by the late 18th century, but surprisingly did not reach France until the First World War. In Jass games  and other games where the King and Queen of trumps is a scoring combination, the King-Queen pair was often known as "belle", "bela" or a similar term, and this is probably the origin of the French name Belote. The name "La Coinche" comes from "coincher", which is a form of "contrer", meaning to contra or double, an action open to player who believes that the opponents\' latest bid will fail, and therefore decides to double the score. The basic game of Belote in which a card is turned during the deal to propose a trump suit is still popular, especially in some rural areas of France. It is sometimes known as "La Tourne", to distinguish it from La Coinche, in which trumps are chosen by bidding. Since the Second World War,  versions of La Coinche have become increasingly popular   and have supplanted the original game in many places.\nPlayers and Cards\nLa Coinche is played between two teams of two players (North/South versus East/West) using a 32-card pack. Deal and play are anticlockwise. The first team that reaches a score of 2000 points or more wins the match. \n The suits are cur (hearts), carreau (diamonds), trfle (clubs) and pique (spades). In a French pack the aces and picture have indices: 1 = As (Ace), R = Roi (King), D = Dame (Queen), V = Valet (Jack).  The ranks and point values of the cards are different in the trump suit from the other suits. In descending order, they are:\n\n\nTRUMPS \nValet\n>\n9\n>\nAs\n>\n10\n>\nRoi\n>\nDame\n>\n8\n>\n7 \n\n\nPoint value \n20\n\n14\n\n11\n\n10\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n\nOTHER SUITS \nAs\n>\n10\n>\nRoi\n>\nDame\n>\nValet\n>\n9\n>\n8\n>\n7 \n\n\nPoint value \n11\n\n10\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n\nThe objective is to win tricks containing valuable cards. Additional points are available for winning the last trick (10 points for dix de der) and for holding the king and queen of trumps together in hand (20 points for belote). In each deal there is a total of 152 for the cards, plus 10 for the last trick, plus a possible 20 if a Belote is declared, for a grand total of 162 or 182 points.\nThe Deal\nAt the start of a match the dealer is chosen by lot: thereafter the turn to deal passes to the right after each hand. The dealer may shuffle the cards (they must be shuffled before the first deal) and the player to dealers left cuts. The dealer deals all the cards: a batch of 3 cards to each player beginning with the player to his right, then two cards each, then three again (or the cards can be dealt 3-3-2 or 2-3-3). \nThe Bidding\nThe players speak in turn, beginning with the player to dealers right. Each player may: \n\nPass, which does not prevent the player from bidding in future if some other player has bid meanwhile. If all four players pass, the cards are thrown in and the next dealer deals a new hand. \nBid, by announcing the number of points his team will try to take in tricks, and the suit he would like as trumps. The bid must be for at least 82 points (by convention, 82 is bid by saying 80), must be a multiple of 10 and must be higher than the previous bid. (Example of a bid: 90 pique = 90 spades).\nDouble the opponents bid if he thinks the contract will fail: the word for this is coincher. In reply, the opponents can redouble (surcoincher) if confident of succeeding. It is not necessary to wait for your turn to say coinche, but you can only double if the most recent bid was by an opponent. A coinche ends the bidding, except that either the bidder or his partner can surcoincher. \nBid a capot (slam), that is, undertake to win all the tricks, which earns a bonus. A capot bid ends the bidding and cannot be doubled. \n\nEnd of the Bidding \nThe bidding ends if all four players pass, or if the other three players pass after a bid, or if there is a capot bid or a coinche.  \nThe bidding is won by the team that bid last and highest, and their contract is to take at least as many points in tricks as they bid (exception: at least 82 if they bid 80), with the named suit as trumps.\nThe Play\nThe team that won the bidding now try to make their contract. The cards are played out in eight tricks, and the object is to win tricks containing valuable cards.\nThe player to dealers right leads any card of his choice to the first trick. The suit of the first card played to a trick card fixes the suit to be followed. The other players, in anticlockwise, order must each play a card in turn.\n\nPlayers must follow suit if they can. If the card led is not a trump, they may play any card of the suit led, without any obligation to beat the previous cards. However, if a trump is led each player must if possible beat the highest trump in the trick, even if that card was played by their partner. \nIf a player is unable to follow suit, and if the highest card in the trick was played by an opponent, he must play a trump. If an opponent is already winning the trick with a trump, he must play a higher trump if possible; if he does not have a higher trump he must play a lower trump. However, if the highest card in the trick so far was played by his partner, he is allowed to discard even if he has a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led and no trumps may discard any card.\n\nWhoever played the highest trump, or, if no trumps were played, the highest card of the suit that was led wins the trick, and leads a card of his choice to the next trick. Each team stores the tricks it has won in a pile face down in front of one of the players. \nDix de Der\nThe last trick is worth 10 points to the team that wins it, known as dix de der (ten for last). \nBelote\nIf a player in the team that won the bidding holds the king and queen of trumps, he may declare them for 20 points by saying belote as he plays the first of the two cards and rebelote as he plays the second card. The 20 points for Belote count towards making the contract and are scored by the bidding team, even if the contract fails. \nThe Scoring\nWhen all eight tricks have been played, each team counts the points it has won: the cards in its tricks, the last trick and the Belote if declared.\nIn order to succeed, the team that bid the contract must take at least as many points as they bid (at least 82 if they bid 80). (They do not need to take more points than their opponents.) \n\nSuccessful contract \nIf the contract succeeds, the bidding team scores the number of points they took plus the number they bid, and their opponents score the points they took. Scores are rounded to the nearest 10, with scores ending in 5 rounded upwards. If the bidding team wins all the tricks (capot) they score 250 points plus the amount of the bid. If they bid and make capot they score 500, plus 20 for Belote if declared.\nFailed contract \nIf the contract fails, the bidding team scores nothing (except 20 points for Belote if they declared it). Their opponents score 160 plus the amount of the bid. If a bid of capot is lost, the opponents score 500.\nCoinche and surcoinche \nA coinche doubles the score for the bid only, and a surcoinche doubles it again. For example if we bid 100, they say coinche, we declare a Belote, and the contract fails, we score 20 and our opponents score 160 + (100  2) = 360.\n\nThe game ends when one or both teams achieve a score of 2000 points or more, and the team with the higher score wins. In case of a tie, the winners of the latest deal win the game.\nNotes on Bidding\nAs a rough guide one can reckon on about 20 points for each trick won, plus an extra 20 if holding a Belote, so for example one can bid 100 if confident of winning at least 5 tricks. As a refinement, a trick taken with the valet (jack) of trumps is clearly more valuable on average, since the valet is worth 20 points in itself, while tricks in non-trump suits are on average worth less.\nRegular players develop bidding systems, through which they can convey more precise information to their partner. For example an opening bid of 80 may show the jack or nine of trumps, 90 may show both, and 100 the top three trumps V-9-A. There are many possible systems, but note that the opponents can end the auction at any time with a coinche, so in contrast to Bridge, it is unwise to bid a contract that one is not prepared to play.\nVariations\nDeal\nPractice varies as to whether the cards are shuffled before each deal. Some require the dealer to shuffle; in other groups it is optional or even discouraged. In any case it is obligatory for the dealer\'s left-hand opponent to cut the cards. If the cards are not shuffled, players may use their observation of the order in which cards were played in the previous deal and the way the cards were gathered to estimate the likely distribution of cards in the current deal.\nSome allow or require the cards to be dealt in batches of four, instead of in threes and twos.\nSome use a two-stage deal, as in Belote without bidding. Initially just six cards are dealt to each player, in batches of three; then the bidding takes place. After the bidding the dealer deals the last batch of two cards to each player.\nBidding\nSome play that a player may only say "coinche" in turn. In this version, if for example South bids "110 Diamonds" and West believes this will fail, West is not allowed to say anything or give any indication that he or she wishes to coincher until East and North have had their turns to speak. If East decides, for example, to compete with 120 Clubs, then it is no longer possible for West to double South\'s bid.\nSome play that a coinche can only be said in turn and does not end the bidding. So if South bids 100 Hearts and East says "coinche", North can escape by bidding a different suit - say 110 Spades, or West may bid, or South may try a different bid, for example 110 Clubs, at his next turn. The bidding will only end after three consecutive passes. This makes the game more Bridge-like, and opens up the possibility of artificial bids whose purpose is just to convey information.\nSome allow a capot bid to be doubled and redoubled.\nAnother Bridge-like modification is the no trump (sans atout) bid, which proposes a contract in which there is no trump suit and all suits rank from high to low A-10-K-Q-J-9-8-7. When this is used, there is also usually an "all trump" (tout atout) bid in which every suit ranks like the trumps is a normal game: J-9-A-10-K-Q-8-7. Bids still name a number of points, and each must be higher than the last: for example if the previous player said 90 Hearts, this can be outbid by 100 of anything, for example 100 Tout Atout. Usually some adjustments are made to ensure that the number of points in the pack remains 162 including the dix de der. There are various systems, none of them particularly elegant. For example in sans atout the value of an ace may be increased to 19, while in tout atout the card values are reduced to J=14, 9=9, A=6, 10=5, K=3, Q=1. In sans atout there is no belote and no obligation to overtake in the play. In tout atout a belote can be declared in any suit, and players must always beat the highest card in the trick when able to. In both sans atout and tout atout, a player who is unable to follow suit is free to play any card.\nSome introduce a ranking order of suits (and sans atout and tout atout if played) - from lowest to highest: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, sans atout, tout atout. A bid can be overcalled by an equal bid in a higher denomination, or a higher number in any denomination. For example 100 clubs is higher than 90 sans atout, which is higher than 90 hearts. This variant leads to lengthier auctions and potentially more elaborate bidding systems by which partners can exchange information.\nSome allow an additional (highest) bid of gnrale, in which the bidder has to win all eight tricks alone, without help from partner. The bidder of a gnrale may have the right to lead to the first trick.\nPlay of the cards\nIn the rules given above, if a non-trump is led and trumped, a subsequent player who is an opponent of the player whose trump is currently winning the trick, and who also has no card of the suit led, is obliged to trump, even if unable to beat the winning trump. For example, if hearts are trumps, my partner leads the 10, the next player plays the 9, and I have no clubs and my only trump is the 10, I am forced to play it, even though the opponents are certain to win the trick. Undertrumping like this is called "pisser". However, some players, especially in the south of France, do not require this. If a non-trump lead is trumped, then a subsequent player who cannot follow suit is obliged to overtrump if an opponent is currently winning the trick, but is not obliged to play a trump if unable to beat the winning trump. So in the example, if I have no clubs and do not have the V to beat the 9, I am not obliged to play a trump at all, but may discard any card I wish.\nSome also relax the rules when a trump is led, and allow a player whose partner is winning the trick to follow suit with any trump. So under this rule, if I lead the nine of trumps and my partner has the jack (valet), he is not obliged to play it, but can follow with a low trump instead if he has one.\nAnnouncements\nMany allow belote to be announced by any player, not only by a member of the team that won the bidding.\nTraditionally, further announcements are allowed, as in ordinary Belote. These are as follows.\n\n4 cards of the same rank ("carr")\n\n4 jacks: 200 points \n4 nines: 150  points \n4 Aces, 4 tens, 4 Ks, 4 Qs: 100 points \n\n\nSequences from 3 to 5 consecutive cards of the same suit. For this purpose the cards of all suits rank in the order: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7\n\n5 cards: 100 points \n4 cards: 50 points \n3 cards: 20 points\n\n\n\n Combinations of 4 eights or 4 sevens have no value, and sequences longer than 5 cards are declared and counted as any of the 5-card sequences which they include.\nAny player who holds any of these combinations in hand may announce them just before playing to the first trick. However, only one team can score for announcements: the team that announced the highest single combination scores for all its announcements, and the other team scores none of theirs. The highest announcement is determined as follows:\n\nAny carr beats any sequence\nA higher scoring combination beats a lower scoring one\nAmong equal scoring combinations of the same type, one with higher cards beats one with lower cards\nAmong equal sequences consisting of the same cards in different suits, a trump sequence is better than a non-trump one\nAmong equal non-trump sequences, some play that the first to be announced is best; others play that they annul each other and neither team scores.\n\nNote that sequences longer than 5 cards have no special significance. So for example K-Q-J-10-9 is better than Q-J-10-9-8-7, since both count as 5-card sequences and the king is higher than the queen.\nSome allow players to  announce combinations even if it is clear that they cannot be scored because the opponents have the best announcement. Others allow announcements only of combinations that are potentially the best, in which case the team with the best announcement can announce and score additional combinations at the end of the first trick.\nThe declaration of belote is separate from this process. It is declared by saying "belote" and "rebelote" as the two cards are played, and is always scored if declared, irrespective of any other announcements by either team.\nPlaying with announcements makes it possible to bid much higher than in the game without announcements. For example a player who has four jacks can clearly make at least 220 with any suit as trumps. \nSome players, on the other hand, do not allow any announcements at all, not even belote, so that there are always just 162 points in the game. Since the late 20th century, versions without announcements have become more popular, as this is thought to reduce the element of luck. Some reserve the name Belote Contre for variants with few or no announcements, in which a coinche (or contre) is only annouced in turn and does not end the auction.\nScoring\nSome play the game without announcements to a target of 1000 or 1500 rather than 2000. When playing with announcements, it is usual to set a higher target score for winning the game, for example 3000.\nSome play that for a contract to be successful, the bidding team must not only take at least the number of points that they bid: they must also take more points than the opponents. (It is a vestige of this rule that requres a score of at least 82 to win a bid of 80, since at least 82 points are needed to have more than the opponents.) On the other hand, some play that it is only necessary to take as many points as were bid, even in the case of a bid of 80. A few groups require an extra 2 points for every bid - for example at least 112 poionts to win a bid of 110.\nWhen a contract fails, the opponents score not only the bid and the card points, but also the points for announcements if any. Many also award the points for belote to the opponents in this case, even if it was declared by the bidding team. In this case it can be in the bidding team\'s interest to suppress the belote announcement when their contract is likely to fail. They can do this by not saying "rebelote" when playing the second card, in which case the 20 points are not scored.\nThere are various different ways to score capot. Some score it only if it is bid. Some give only 410 points (160+250) to the opponents if it is bid and fails. If a bid of gnrale is allowed, the score for it must be agreed - for example 1000.\nSome score only the points for the bid, not for the cards taken in play. For example if the bid is 100, then either the bidders or their opponents score just 100 (or 200 in case of a coinche) depending only on whether the bidders succeeded in their contract.\nWhen coinche is said, some apply the double not just to the bid but to the entire score, so that for example whena team  loses a 100 bid with coinche and there are no announcements, the opponent score 520 = 2  (100 + 160).\nSome play that a surcoinche does not double the score again, but only increases the multiplier from 2 to 3.\nReferences and Other Coinche Web Sites\nRules in French can be found on Jean-Franois Bustarret\'s Coinche page. \nThe French Wikipedia page on La Coinche has a large collection of variants.\n Dominique Hazael-Massieux\'s site has rules and examples of Contre in French and also in English. \nCoinche Online Servers and Software\n You can download Laurent Pellenc\'s Belote Bridge program from his page.

There is a huge number of variations of this game, differing between regions of France and between  groups of players. These variations affect every part of the game: the deal, the bidding, the play and the scoring. On this page a basic form of the La Coinche will be described first, followed by a selection of common variations, and some references to sources where further variations can be found.\nBelote belongs to the Jass family of games, which originated in the Netherlands in the early 18th century or earlier. They spread across Europe, reaching Switzerland by the late 18th century, but surprisingly did not reach France until the First World War. In Jass games  and other games where the King and Queen of trumps is a scoring combination, the King-Queen pair was often known as "belle", "bela" or a similar term, and this is probably the origin of the French name Belote. The name "La Coinche" comes from "coincher", which is a form of "contrer", meaning to contra or double, an action open to player who believes that the opponents\' latest bid will fail, and therefore decides to double the score. The basic game of Belote in which a card is turned during the deal to propose a trump suit is still popular, especially in some rural areas of France. It is sometimes known as "La Tourne", to distinguish it from La Coinche, in which trumps are chosen by bidding. Since the Second World War,  versions of La Coinche have become increasingly popular   and have supplanted the original game in many places.\nPlayers and Cards\nLa Coinche is played between two teams of two players (North/South versus East/West) using a 32-card pack. Deal and play are anticlockwise. The first team that reaches a score of 2000 points or more wins the match. \n The suits are cur (hearts), carreau (diamonds), trfle (clubs) and pique (spades). In a French pack the aces and picture have indices: 1 = As (Ace), R = Roi (King), D = Dame (Queen), V = Valet (Jack).  The ranks and point values of the cards are different in the trump suit from the other suits. In descending order, they are:\n\n\nTRUMPS \nValet\n>\n9\n>\nAs\n>\n10\n>\nRoi\n>\nDame\n>\n8\n>\n7 \n\n\nPoint value \n20\n\n14\n\n11\n\n10\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n\nOTHER SUITS \nAs\n>\n10\n>\nRoi\n>\nDame\n>\nValet\n>\n9\n>\n8\n>\n7 \n\n\nPoint value \n11\n\n10\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n\nThe objective is to win tricks containing valuable cards. Additional points are available for winning the last trick (10 points for dix de der) and for holding the king and queen of trumps together in hand (20 points for belote). In each deal there is a total of 152 for the cards, plus 10 for the last trick, plus a possible 20 if a Belote is declared, for a grand total of 162 or 182 points.\nThe Deal\nAt the start of a match the dealer is chosen by lot: thereafter the turn to deal passes to the right after each hand. The dealer may shuffle the cards (they must be shuffled before the first deal) and the player to dealers left cuts. The dealer deals all the cards: a batch of 3 cards to each player beginning with the player to his right, then two cards each, then three again (or the cards can be dealt 3-3-2 or 2-3-3). \nThe Bidding\nThe players speak in turn, beginning with the player to dealers right. Each player may: \n\nPass, which does not prevent the player from bidding in future if some other player has bid meanwhile. If all four players pass, the cards are thrown in and the next dealer deals a new hand. \nBid, by announcing the number of points his team will try to take in tricks, and the suit he would like as trumps. The bid must be for at least 82 points (by convention, 82 is bid by saying 80), must be a multiple of 10 and must be higher than the previous bid. (Example of a bid: 90 pique = 90 spades).\nDouble the opponents bid if he thinks the contract will fail: the word for this is coincher. In reply, the opponents can redouble (surcoincher) if confident of succeeding. It is not necessary to wait for your turn to say coinche, but you can only double if the most recent bid was by an opponent. A coinche ends the bidding, except that either the bidder or his partner can surcoincher. \nBid a capot (slam), that is, undertake to win all the tricks, which earns a bonus. A capot bid ends the bidding and cannot be doubled. \n\nEnd of the Bidding \nThe bidding ends if all four players pass, or if the other three players pass after a bid, or if there is a capot bid or a coinche.  \nThe bidding is won by the team that bid last and highest, and their contract is to take at least as many points in tricks as they bid (exception: at least 82 if they bid 80), with the named suit as trumps.\nThe Play\nThe team that won the bidding now try to make their contract. The cards are played out in eight tricks, and the object is to win tricks containing valuable cards.\nThe player to dealers right leads any card of his choice to the first trick. The suit of the first card played to a trick card fixes the suit to be followed. The other players, in anticlockwise, order must each play a card in turn.\n\nPlayers must follow suit if they can. If the card led is not a trump, they may play any card of the suit led, without any obligation to beat the previous cards. However, if a trump is led each player must if possible beat the highest trump in the trick, even if that card was played by their partner. \nIf a player is unable to follow suit, and if the highest card in the trick was played by an opponent, he must play a trump. If an opponent is already winning the trick with a trump, he must play a higher trump if possible; if he does not have a higher trump he must play a lower trump. However, if the highest card in the trick so far was played by his partner, he is allowed to discard even if he has a trump. A player who has no card of the suit led and no trumps may discard any card.\n\nWhoever played the highest trump, or, if no trumps were played, the highest card of the suit that was led wins the trick, and leads a card of his choice to the next trick. Each team stores the tricks it has won in a pile face down in front of one of the players. \nDix de Der\nThe last trick is worth 10 points to the team that wins it, known as dix de der (ten for last). \nBelote\nIf a player in the team that won the bidding holds the king and queen of trumps, he may declare them for 20 points by saying belote as he plays the first of the two cards and rebelote as he plays the second card. The 20 points for Belote count towards making the contract and are scored by the bidding team, even if the contract fails. \nThe Scoring\nWhen all eight tricks have been played, each team counts the points it has won: the cards in its tricks, the last trick and the Belote if declared.\nIn order to succeed, the team that bid the contract must take at least as many points as they bid (at least 82 if they bid 80). (They do not need to take more points than their opponents.) \n\nSuccessful contract \nIf the contract succeeds, the bidding team scores the number of points they took plus the number they bid, and their opponents score the points they took. Scores are rounded to the nearest 10, with scores ending in 5 rounded upwards. If the bidding team wins all the tricks (capot) they score 250 points plus the amount of the bid. If they bid and make capot they score 500, plus 20 for Belote if declared.\nFailed contract \nIf the contract fails, the bidding team scores nothing (except 20 points for Belote if they declared it). Their opponents score 160 plus the amount of the bid. If a bid of capot is lost, the opponents score 500.\nCoinche and surcoinche \nA coinche doubles the score for the bid only, and a surcoinche doubles it again. For example if we bid 100, they say coinche, we declare a Belote, and the contract fails, we score 20 and our opponents score 160 + (100  2) = 360.\n\nThe game ends when one or both teams achieve a score of 2000 points or more, and the team with the higher score wins. In case of a tie, the winners of the latest deal win the game.\nNotes on Bidding\nAs a rough guide one can reckon on about 20 points for each trick won, plus an extra 20 if holding a Belote, so for example one can bid 100 if confident of winning at least 5 tricks. As a refinement, a trick taken with the valet (jack) of trumps is clearly more valuable on average, since the valet is worth 20 points in itself, while tricks in non-trump suits are on average worth less.\nRegular players develop bidding systems, through which they can convey more precise information to their partner. For example an opening bid of 80 may show the jack or nine of trumps, 90 may show both, and 100 the top three trumps V-9-A. There are many possible systems, but note that the opponents can end the auction at any time with a coinche, so in contrast to Bridge, it is unwise to bid a contract that one is not prepared to play.\nVariations\nDeal\nPractice varies as to whether the cards are shuffled before each deal. Some require the dealer to shuffle; in other groups it is optional or even discouraged. In any case it is obligatory for the dealer\'s left-hand opponent to cut the cards. If the cards are not shuffled, players may use their observation of the order in which cards were played in the previous deal and the way the cards were gathered to estimate the likely distribution of cards in the current deal.\nSome allow or require the cards to be dealt in batches of four, instead of in threes and twos.\nSome use a two-stage deal, as in Belote without bidding. Initially just six cards are dealt to each player, in batches of three; then the bidding takes place. After the bidding the dealer deals the last batch of two cards to each player.\nBidding\nSome play that a player may only say "coinche" in turn. In this version, if for example South bids "110 Diamonds" and West believes this will fail, West is not allowed to say anything or give any indication that he or she wishes to coincher until East and North have had their turns to speak. If East decides, for example, to compete with 120 Clubs, then it is no longer possible for West to double South\'s bid.\nSome play that a coinche can only be said in turn and does not end the bidding. So if South bids 100 Hearts and East says "coinche", North can escape by bidding a different suit - say 110 Spades, or West may bid, or South may try a different bid, for example 110 Clubs, at his next turn. The bidding will only end after three consecutive passes. This makes the game more Bridge-like, and opens up the possibility of artificial bids whose purpose is just to convey information.\nSome allow a capot bid to be doubled and redoubled.\nAnother Bridge-like modification is the no trump (sans atout) bid, which proposes a contract in which there is no trump suit and all suits rank from high to low A-10-K-Q-J-9-8-7. When this is used, there is also usually an "all trump" (tout atout) bid in which every suit ranks like the trumps is a normal game: J-9-A-10-K-Q-8-7. Bids still name a number of points, and each must be higher than the last: for example if the previous player said 90 Hearts, this can be outbid by 100 of anything, for example 100 Tout Atout. Usually some adjustments are made to ensure that the number of points in the pack remains 162 including the dix de der. There are various systems, none of them particularly elegant. For example in sans atout the value of an ace may be increased to 19, while in tout atout the card values are reduced to J=14, 9=9, A=6, 10=5, K=3, Q=1. In sans atout there is no belote and no obligation to overtake in the play. In tout atout a belote can be declared in any suit, and players must always beat the highest card in the trick when able to. In both sans atout and tout atout, a player who is unable to follow suit is free to play any card.\nSome introduce a ranking order of suits (and sans atout and tout atout if played) - from lowest to highest: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, sans atout, tout atout. A bid can be overcalled by an equal bid in a higher denomination, or a higher number in any denomination. For example 100 clubs is higher than 90 sans atout, which is higher than 90 hearts. This variant leads to lengthier auctions and potentially more elaborate bidding systems by which partners can exchange information.\nSome allow an additional (highest) bid of gnrale, in which the bidder has to win all eight tricks alone, without help from partner. The bidder of a gnrale may have the right to lead to the first trick.\nPlay of the cards\nIn the rules given above, if a non-trump is led and trumped, a subsequent player who is an opponent of the player whose trump is currently winning the trick, and who also has no card of the suit led, is obliged to trump, even if unable to beat the winning trump. For example, if hearts are trumps, my partner leads the 10, the next player plays the 9, and I have no clubs and my only trump is the 10, I am forced to play it, even though the opponents are certain to win the trick. Undertrumping like this is called "pisser". However, some players, especially in the south of France, do not require this. If a non-trump lead is trumped, then a subsequent player who cannot follow suit is obliged to overtrump if an opponent is currently winning the trick, but is not obliged to play a trump if unable to beat the winning trump. So in the example, if I have no clubs and do not have the V to beat the 9, I am not obliged to play a trump at all, but may discard any card I wish.\nSome also relax the rules when a trump is led, and allow a player whose partner is winning the trick to follow suit with any trump. So under this rule, if I lead the nine of trumps and my partner has the jack (valet), he is not obliged to play it, but can follow with a low trump instead if he has one.\nAnnouncements\nMany allow belote to be announced by any player, not only by a member of the team that won the bidding.\nTraditionally, further announcements are allowed, as in ordinary Belote. These are as follows.\n\n4 cards of the same rank ("carr")\n\n4 jacks: 200 points \n4 nines: 150  points \n4 Aces, 4 tens, 4 Ks, 4 Qs: 100 points \n\n\nSequences from 3 to 5 consecutive cards of the same suit. For this purpose the cards of all suits rank in the order: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7\n\n5 cards: 100 points \n4 cards: 50 points \n3 cards: 20 points\n\n\n\n Combinations of 4 eights or 4 sevens have no value, and sequences longer than 5 cards are declared and counted as any of the 5-card sequences which they include.\nAny player who holds any of these combinations in hand may announce them just before playing to the first trick. However, only one team can score for announcements: the team that announced the highest single combination scores for all its announcements, and the other team scores none of theirs. The highest announcement is determined as follows:\n\nAny carr beats any sequence\nA higher scoring combination beats a lower scoring one\nAmong equal scoring combinations of the same type, one with higher cards beats one with lower cards\nAmong equal sequences consisting of the same cards in different suits, a trump sequence is better than a non-trump one\nAmong equal non-trump sequences, some play that the first to be announced is best; others play that they annul each other and neither team scores.\n\nNote that sequences longer than 5 cards have no special significance. So for example K-Q-J-10-9 is better than Q-J-10-9-8-7, since both count as 5-card sequences and the king is higher than the queen.\nSome allow players to  announce combinations even if it is clear that they cannot be scored because the opponents have the best announcement. Others allow announcements only of combinations that are potentially the best, in which case the team with the best announcement can announce and score additional combinations at the end of the first trick.\nThe declaration of belote is separate from this process. It is declared by saying "belote" and "rebelote" as the two cards are played, and is always scored if declared, irrespective of any other announcements by either team.\nPlaying with announcements makes it possible to bid much higher than in the game without announcements. For example a player who has four jacks can clearly make at least 220 with any suit as trumps. \nSome players, on the other hand, do not allow any announcements at all, not even belote, so that there are always just 162 points in the game. Since the late 20th century, versions without announcements have become more popular, as this is thought to reduce the element of luck. Some reserve the name Belote Contre for variants with few or no announcements, in which a coinche (or contre) is only annouced in turn and does not end the auction.\nScoring\nSome play the game without announcements to a target of 1000 or 1500 rather than 2000. When playing with announcements, it is usual to set a higher target score for winning the game, for example 3000.\nSome play that for a contract to be successful, the bidding team must not only take at least the number of points that they bid: they must also take more points than the opponents. (It is a vestige of this rule that requres a score of at least 82 to win a bid of 80, since at least 82 points are needed to have more than the opponents.) On the other hand, some play that it is only necessary to take as many points as were bid, even in the case of a bid of 80. A few groups require an extra 2 points for every bid - for example at least 112 poionts to win a bid of 110.\nWhen a contract fails, the opponents score not only the bid and the card points, but also the points for announcements if any. Many also award the points for belote to the opponents in this case, even if it was declared by the bidding team. In this case it can be in the bidding team\'s interest to suppress the belote announcement when their contract is likely to fail. They can do this by not saying "rebelote" when playing the second card, in which case the 20 points are not scored.\nThere are various different ways to score capot. Some score it only if it is bid. Some give only 410 points (160+250) to the opponents if it is bid and fails. If a bid of gnrale is allowed, the score for it must be agreed - for example 1000.\nSome score only the points for the bid, not for the cards taken in play. For example if the bid is 100, then either the bidders or their opponents score just 100 (or 200 in case of a coinche) depending only on whether the bidders succeeded in their contract.\nWhen coinche is said, some apply the double not just to the bid but to the entire score, so that for example whena team  loses a 100 bid with coinche and there are no announcements, the opponent score 520 = 2  (100 + 160).\nSome play that a surcoinche does not double the score again, but only increases the multiplier from 2 to 3.\nReferences and Other Coinche Web Sites\nRules in French can be found on Jean-Franois Bustarret\'s Coinche page. \nThe French Wikipedia page on La Coinche has a large collection of variants.\n Dominique Hazael-Massieux\'s site has rules and examples of Contre in French and also in English. \nCoinche Online Servers and Software\n You can download Laurent Pellenc\'s Belote Bridge program from his page.

It is a close relative of Clobyosh (also known as Bela), which is played in Jewish communities in many parts of the world, and of the Dutch game Klaverjassen.\n\nBelote is a point-trick taking game for 2, 3, or 4 players. Its most interesting form is the 4 player version, which is described first.  \n\nA 32 card deck is needed ( A K Q J 10 9 8 7).\n\nCard point values\n   \nCards in the trump suit both rank and score differently from those in other suits.\nNotice the promotion of the trump 9 and J.\n\n\n\nTrump suitOther suits\nJ20A11\n9141010\nA11K4\n1010Q3\nK4J2\nQ390\n8080\n7070\n\n\nBelote for four players\n\nPlayers form two teams of two partners. Partners sit at opposite seats. The direction of deal, bidding and play is anti-clockwise.\n \nThe deal and the bidding\n\nThe pack is never shuffled at Belote. The player before the dealer in rotation (i.e. the player to dealer\'s left) cuts the pack.  The dealer gives a set of three cards to each player, then another set of two cards, and turns the next card face up.    \n\nThe player after the dealer in rotation (the player to dealer\'s right) can now "take", i.e. choose the turn-up card suit as a trump, or pass. If this player passes, the next player can take or pass, and so on around the table. If all 4 players pass, each in turn has a second chance to take, choosing a trump suit other than that of the face up card. If all players pass a second time, the cards are collected together and the next player in rotation deals. \n\nAs soon as a player takes (in the first or second round of bidding), the bidding ends. The taker is given the turn-up card (whether it is a trump or not) and the deal resumes. Each player except the taker is dealt a further packet of three cards, and the taker is dealt only two cards. These cards are dealt in rotation, beginning to dealer\'s right and ending with the dealer. \n\nDeclarations\n\nDeclarations are particular sets of cards held in players\' hands, which give players extra points. There are three sorts of declarations: \n\n4 cards of the same rank, called "carr" in French, or "square"\n\n4 jacks: 200 points\n  4 nines: 150  points\n  4 Aces, tens, Ks, Qs: 100 points\n\n4 eights and 4 sevens are not counted. \n\nSequences from 3 to 5 cards of the same suit. There is yet another ranking of cards for sequences, by descending order: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7\n\n3 cards: 20 points\n  4 cards: 50 points\n  5 cards: 100 points\n\nSequences longer than 5 cards are declared and counted as any of the 5-card sequences which they include. \n\nBelote and Rebelote are the trump King and Queen held together in one player\'s hand, and are counted 20 points. \n\nRanking of the declarations: \n\nBelote-Rebelote always scores 20 points, irrespective of other declarations.\n\nApart from Belote-Rebelote, only the team holding the highest declaration is entitled to count its declarations. The other team scores nothing even if it holds several inferior declarations giving a point total higher than the highest declaration. \n\nA square is higher than a 5 card sequence. Between equally long sequences, the one containing the higher ranked cards wins. If there are two sequences of equal rank, and one is trumps, the trump sequence wins. If none is trump, the one held by the player who is earliest in rotation wins (playing anticlockwise, the player to dealer\'s right is first in rotation and the dealer is last). A particular card may not be involved in two declarations (except in Belote-Rebelote).   \n\nWhen to declare, apart from Belote-Rebelote:\n\nThe traditional method, now increasingly ignored (see variations below) is the following: \n\nEach player makes his declaration(s) at the moment he plays his card during the first trick, saying "4 kings", "sequence of 4", etc. \n  The first trick is collected. \n  If necessary there is a contention to find out the winning declaration. All declarations made by the side with the winning declaration are scored.\n  A player of the other team may ask to see the cards of the declaration(s) which were scored.  These must then be shown. Of course if a card involved in the declaration has been played in the first trick the opponents will remember. \n\nIf the highest sequence announced by each side is equal, the first announcer in rotation specifies the highest card of the sequence, and the next announcer either specifies his highest card if it beats the opponent\'s, or says "good!" if it does not. If the heights are the same, the player who holds a trump sequence specifies it. \n  \n\nWhen to declare Belote-Rebelote:\n   \nA player who holds the king and queen of trumps declares "Belote" when playing the first of these card and "Rebelote" when playing the second.\n  \nThe Play\n\nThe next player in rotation after the dealer (the player to dealer\'s right) leads a card. The subsequent players must follow suit if they can. If the card led is trump, subsequent players must not only follow suit, but also play a trump card that beats all previous cards if they can, whoever holds the trick at this stage.  \n\n\nTrumping: If a player is unable to follow to a non-trump suit, and an opponent is currently winning the trick, he must trump if he can, otherwise he may discard any card. If his partner is currently winning the  trick he is free to either trump, or discard any card. \n\nOvertrumping and undertrumping: If a player is the third or the fourth to play, and is unable to follow a non-trump suit, and the opponent just before him has trumped, he must overtrump if he can. If he has trumps but is unable to overtrump, he must still play a trump, although he does not benefit from doing so. This is termed "undertrumping", or "pisser" in French Belote jargon.  \n\nIf   the fourth  player is unable to follow suit to a plain suit lead which his partner has already trumped, and his partner is winning the trick (because the third player  either discarded or undertrumped),  the fourth player may either discard (even if he holds trump) or overtrump. If he is unable to overtrump, having no sufficiently high trumps, he may either discard or undertrump.\n\nTo summarize these rules, you must always follow suit, if unable to follow you must trump unless your partner is winning the trick (in French: le partenaire est matre), and whenever playing a trump you must beat the highest trump in the trick if possible. \n\nAs in most trick-taking games, the player who won the trick has the lead to the next one. \n\nThe last trick counts 10 points for the team who wins it. This is called "Dix de Der" in French; "Der" is a shortening of Dernier, the last. The point total including these 10 is 162 points. \n\nScoring\n    \nThe tricks taken by each team are added to the team\'s scoring declarations. (Remember that, apart from Belote-Rebelote, only one team can score for declarations).\n\nIf the team who "took" wins at least as many points as the other team, the taking team has made its contract, and both teams add their scores into their column. If the taker\'s team\'s points are less than those of the opponents, the takers are "dedans" (inside), and the opponents score 162 points plus the losing team\'s declarations, if any, plus their own declarations.  \n\nIf the team who took wins all the tricks, that team scores 100 points instead of the Dix de Der, giving a total of 252 points plus declarations. This situation is called "Capot" in French ( "tre capot" for the victims, "mettre capot" for the winners). The team which took no tricks forfeit their own declarations other than Belote-Rebelote, if any. In some exceptional cases it turns out that the team who took wins no tricks at all. Despite the likely derision in this case the other team wins only the regular 252 points, plus all the declarations of both teams. \n\nThe winning team is the first to reach a total of 1000 points.  If both sides reach 1000 points on the same hand, the game is drawn.\nVariations\n\nDirection of play\nPeople often play the whole game clockwise, rather than anticlockwise. \nDeal\nSome play that the dealer is free to either follow the dealing scheme described above, or deal the sets of 2 cards first.\nDeclarations\nEtiquette: nowadays most players will make their declarations and show them as soon as they notice them in their hand.\nPlayers can agree to play without declarations. This reduces the luck element of the game. In tournaments, declarations other than Belote-Rebelote are not counted.\nSome play that when playing the King and Queen which form a Belote-Rebelote, the King must be played first. \nCriteria for winning the contract\nSome do not include the declarations in the point total when determining whether the takers made their contract. In this case, making one\'s contract means obtaining at least 81 points, without regard to the declarations. \nSome demand that in order to make the contract, the taker\'s team must have more points than the opponents. In case of equality, the taker\'s team loses and the opponents get all the points.\nWhen both teams get the same amount of points, some play that the result is undecided, and the points from this deal are held in abeyance. On the next deal, if the previous taker\'s team makes a contract or causes the other team\'s contract to fail its contract, then each team gets the equal number of points from the tied deal added to its score. If the previous taker\'s team loses its contract, or their opponents make a contract, the whole 162 points + declarations held in abeyance are given the opponents of the taker from the tied deal. \n\nSome play that when the points are equal, only the bidders\' opponents score their points. The bidders\' points are held in abeyance and added to the winning team\'s score in the next deal. This process is sometimes known as "litige".\nRules of play\nSome players (probably influenced by Tarot) use a different rule for undertrumping. The fourth to play after a non-trump card has been trumped by his partner, when unable to either follow suit or overtrump, must undertrump even if his partner holds the trick. So in this variation, if the trick has already been trumped by your partner and you also have no cards of the suit led, then:\n\nif you are able to overtrump, you may either do so or you may throw away from another suit, but you are not allowed to undertrump;\nif you have trumps but are unable to overtrump, you must undertrump if you can - you cannot throw away another suit;\nif have no trumps, then of course you must throw away another suit.\n\nIn French, this curious variation is is described by the phrase: "On est toujours oblig de pisser". The regular rule is: "On ne pisse pas sur le partenaire".\nScoring\nAnother probable influence of Tarot is rounding up scores to the closest multiple of 5 or 10, to make point adding faster. \nSome people play that a defending team which is capot (takes no tricks) still scores their declarations. If this variation is played, it is possible that the defending team scores more than the takers, even without making a trick. It is generally agreed that in this case the takers are not dedans; both teams score their points. The defenders have to take at least one trick to put the takers dedans.\nEnding the game: L\'Arrt\nIf you have just won just won a trick and you think that your team already has the necessary 1000 points to win the game, including any declarations and the tricks you have won so far, you can stop the game. The points in the tricks played so far are counted and if you really do have at least 1000 you win, no matter how many points the other team has. If you are wrong and you have less than 1000 points, the other team wins - even if they had no chance of getting to 1000 had play continued. \nIf you stop the game when you are on the taker\'s side, you also have to continue playing the hand to demonstrate that you can take at least as many points as the opponents on that hand, otherwise you will not be allowed to count any points from the current hand towards your 1000 and your side loses the game.\nNote: It is not permitted to look back into previous tricks to count their points when deciding whether to stop the game - you have to remember the points you have taken.\n\nBelote Dcouverte\n\nMost regular Belote players are reluctant to play it with a number of players other than four, but here is an interesting variation for 2 players: "Belote with exposed cards" (Belote Dcouverte).  \n\nThe Deal\n\nA 32-card deck is used. \n\nThe dealer mentally draws a border-line at the middle of the table between himself and his opponent, and deals:\n\n4 face-down cards in a row, close to this line, in the opponent\'s camp.\n  4 face-down cards close to the line in his own camp\n  4 face-down cards adjacent to the first series in the opponent\'s camp.\n  4 face-down cards adjacent to the second series in his own camp.\n\nHe then repeats exactly the same scheme covering each face-down card with a face-up card. \n\n\nThe Bidding\n\nThe last card that was dealt in the dealer\'s camp indicates the trump suit at the first round of bidding. If necessary there is second round of bidding, exactly as in Belote. The taker does not, however, take the card indicating the trump suit. It continues to belong to the dealer.\n\nThe Play\n\nThe non-dealer chooses one of his face-up cards, puts it on the side of the table to initiate the first trick. The dealer chooses one of his face-up cards, according to regular Belote rules regarding following suit, trumping,\nbeating a trump card, and discarding. The trick is taken by either player according to Belote rules. Then both players turn the face-down cards which were underneath the played cards face-up. In the following tricks, players may play either a face-up card that still covers a face-down card, or an isolated face-up card from the previous tricks. At the end of each trick, any face-down card which is no longer covered by a face-up card is turned face-up. As in Belote, the winner of each trick has the lead to the next one. The play continues until the 16 tricks have been played. \n\nThe Score\n\nCard point values are the same as in Belote, but declarations and Belote-Rebelote do not count. The cards taken by each player are scored as in Belote. (You are reminded that the point total including the 10 for the last trick is 162, so you need count only the smaller heap.) As in Belote, the taker loses if he gets 81 points or fewer. \n\nVariations\n\nSome play that the player who leads to a trick turns his corresponding face-down card up immediately.  This often affects the other player\'s choice.\n\nIt must be agreed whether to count the Belote-Rebelote, and the other declarations. \n\nSome Belote variations like No-Trumps, All-Trumps, or even La Coinche can be adapted. Games similar to Belote lend themselves to this variation.\n\nOther Belote WWW pages and software\nThe Fdration Franaise de Belote was established in 2013 to promote the game and organise tournaments.\nAt GameDuell you can play Belote online against live opponents.\nBelote is also popular in Bulgaria.

The game has a unique scoring principle of giving points for matching ends of a single train of play.  We do not know whether the name of this game has any connection with the cities of Bergen in Norway or  Bergen op Zoom in the Netherlands.\nEquipment\nThe game uses a double six domino set.  However, the game can be played with larger domino sets, but the results are poor because scoring is much harder.  However, you can play with two (or more) double six domino sets if you have more than four players.\nScore keeping can be made easier by issuing every player 10 or 15 chips (depending on the number of players) before the first round of play.  As a player scores points, they return that number of chips to the container from which they came; the first player to discard all of his chips is the winner.\nThe Deal\nThe number of tiles drawn depends on the number of players.\n2 players get six tile each, leaving a boneyard of 16 tiles.\n\n3 players get six tiles each, leaving a boneyard of 10 tiles.\n4 players get five tiles each, leaving a boneyard of 8 tiles.\n\nTwo of the tiles in the boneyard are reserved and can mever be drawn.  As a convention, the two reserved tiles can be stacked on top of each other if your set does not have brass spinners in the tiles. \nThe Play\nThe player with the lowest double plays first and play continues around the table clockwise.  Other players add to either end of the train.  Doubles are played across the line of the train, but are not spinners.\nA player not able to add onto the train draws new tiles from the boneyard until he can play or until the boneyard is reduced to the two reserved tiles.  There is no limit on the size of his hand.  If a player can neither play nor draw from the boneyard, he passes his turn.\nPlay continues until someone dominoes or the game blocks.\nScoring\nA player scores 2 points when his tile makes both ends of the train equal.  This means that the lead will always get 2 points for setting the first double.  This is called a "double header" because there are two exposed ends from the same suit.\nA player scores 3 points when his play makes one end of the train equal to the double on the other end.  He may have played either single or double tile. This is called a "triple header" because there are three exposed ends (remember the double is played across the line of the train) from the same suit.\nA player within 2 points of winning scores only 1 point for a double header or a triple header.\nA player within 3 points of winning scores only 2 point for a double header or a triple header.\nThe player who dominoes or wins a blocked round scores 2 points.\nA game is 15 points for 2 players and 10 points for 3 or 4 players.\nA round is blocked when nobody can play and there are at least two dominoes in the boneyard.  Special rules apply for determining the winner of a blocked round.  Unfortunately, there are several versions of these rules:\n\nThe American Rules \nThese rules are from Dominic C.Armanino (DOMINOES: POPULAR GAMES, RULES AND STRATEGY; Sterling Publishing Co.; ISBN 0-80694948-1; 1978.):\n\nIf only one player has NO doubles in his hand, he wins.  \nIf nobody has a double, the player with the lowest pip total in his hand wins.  \nIf more than one player has a double, the player with fewest number of tiles wins.  Pips are not counted.  \nIf everyone has a double, the player with the lowest double wins.\n\nThe German Rules \n\nThese rules are due to Reiner F. Mller (DOMINOES: BASIC RULES & VARIATIONS; Sterling Publishing, New York; ISBN 0-8069-3880-3).  Apply these test in this order to determine the winner:\n\nThe player who has NO doubles in his hand.  \nThe player with the FEWEST doubles in his hand.  \nThe player with fewest number of pips on his tiles.  \n\nSimple Method\n\nAnother option for settling a blocked hand given in several older Hoyles and in DOMINOES by Gary M. Grady and Suzanne Goldberg (Gamescape Publications; ISBN 1-887594-01-9; 1995) is simply to use the lowest total number of pips to decide the winner and award a score of 1 point to that player. If two hands tie, there is no score.\n\nNotice the slight difference in these rules and consider a round in a three player game that blocks like this:\n\n\nA = [0-0] [1-2] \nB = [1-1] \nC = [2-2]\n\nUnder the German rules, we would analyze the hand as follows:\n  \n\nRule (1) does not apply because everyone has a double.\nRule (2) does not apply because everyone has the same number of doubles, namely one.\nRule (3) applies and Player B wins with a total of two pips.\n\nHowever, under the American rules, the logic would be:\n  \n\nRule (1) does not apply because everyone has a double.\nRule (2) does not apply because everyone has a double.\nRule (3) does not apply because two players have one tile each.\nRule (4) does apply and Mr. A wins.\n\nMr. B would win under the simple rules.\nIt is the author\'s opinion that the simple rule is common enough and easier to apply than the other options, and therefore should be preferred. \nComments & Strategy\nThe trick of counting the number of occurrences of a suit on the board is very useful in this game.  Remember, each suit appears eight times in the ends of the tiles in a double six domino set, so half of the available matching ends are used up at each double.\nDoubles are important, so you should hold them as long as possible to get a triple header.\nA blocked game can be important, so know and use the particular rules you have agreed upon.\nSince the count of the pips is not used for scoring, Bergen can be played by children with picture dominoes.  The rules for a blocked game will need to be changed to suit the pictures and the age of the children.  For example, if animals are used on the dominoes, then the player holding the double with the smallest animal is winner.  If nobody has a double, the player with the fewest tiles wins.\nVariations\nThe lead goes to the highest double, not the lowest.\nThe number of tiles dealt at start varies in different parts of the world.\nNo tile may be played until both ends of the initial double have been played upon.\nThe game can also be played with larger sets.  In these variants, the first double is usually a spinner.  See the rules for Double Bergen.\nIn some variants, the player going domino scores five points.\nOther Web Sites\n\nA set of rules of Bergen can be found on the Domino Plaza site.\n\n\nJoe Celko\'s rules of Bergen originally appeared on the Game Cabinet site.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Western Domino Games > Bergen\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net) and is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       Joe Celko, John McLeod 2001, 2008.

Five tricks are played and the winner of each wins one fifth of the pool while anyone who takes no tricks at all must pay into the pool for the next deal. There are many variants of this game. On this page I first describe a version played near Rome, which was explained to me by Paolo Ronzoni. In the variations section I have included some other versions of the game described in various books and web sites.\nPlayers and Cards\nThis is a game for 4 to 6 players, each playing for themselves. Deal, bidding and play are anticlockwise. \nThis game is usually played for stakes. Before beginning the players should agree the amount of the ante, which each player normally pays to the pool before each deal, and what additional amount (if any) must be paid by players who stay in the game rather than folding. The pool in this game is  called la bestia (the beast).\nAn Italian 40-card pack is used, with either  Latin or French suits. With latin suits, the rank of the cards from high to low is: Ace, 3, King (Re), Horse (Cavallo), Jack (Fante), 7, 6, 5, 4, 2. If French suited cards are used, the Queen (Donna) replaces the Horse.\nThe position of the 3 as second highest card between the Ace and King may seem strange to players who are not used to Mediterranean card games. For Italian players, however, it is natural to use this order, which is the same as in the popular Italian game Briscola.\nDeal and Card Exchange\nBefore the deal, each player pays the agreed stake to the pool. \n The dealer is chosen at random for the first deal. Subsequently the turn to deal passes to the right. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s left cuts, and the dealer  five cards to each player in a single batch, the player to dealer\'s right receiving the first five cards. After the five cards dealt to the dealer, the next card is turned face up to indicate the trump suit and the remaining cards are stacked face down on the table.\nHaving looked at their cards, the players act in anticlockwise order around the table, beginning with the player to dealer\'s right. The possible actions are as follows:\n\nFold. The player places his cards face down on the table. This action means that he does not wish to play. A player who has folded cannot win any part of the pool, but is safe from having to pay to the pool.\nPlay. The player says "gioco" (I play) and discards from 0 to 5 cards, placing them face down on the table. The dealer gives the player an equal number of new cards from the undealt part of the deck in exchange. If the deck runs out, the dealer shuffles all the discarded cards to make a new deck, and continues giving replacement cards from this new deck.\nKnock. When a player knocks on the table, no further exchanges are possible and play begins. The knocker (il bussante) does not exchange any cards on that turn. Note that if a player knocks at his first turn, anyone who has not yet had a turn to speak has no chance to fold or exchange: they are forced to play with the cards they were dealt.\n\'Terzo se devo\'. This can only be announced at a player\'s first turn to speak. The player undertakes to be the \'third player if needed\'. At this player\'s next turn to speak, the player must fold if there are already three players in the game. If there are fewer than three players, the \'terzo se devo\' player becomes an ordinary player who may fold, play or knock. If a player knocks, then anyone who has said \'terzo se devo\' and not had a subsequent turn to speak must fold if there are at least three other players and fold otherwise. If several players said \'terzo se devo\', then the earliest in turn after the knocker must play until there are three players, and the remainder must fold.\n\nThis process continues around the table for as many circuits as necessary (skipping any players who have folded) until someone knocks. At this point all players who have not folded must pay to the pool the agreed additional stake (if any) for playing the game.\nNotes:\n\nPlaying and exchanging 0 cards is not the same as knocking. If you just exchange 0 cards you allow the other players to continue exchanging.\nThe terzo se devo option is used by a player who would be happy to fold if there enough players, but  wishes to join in if there are not more than two other players, to prevent these players from sharing the pool between them.\n\nPlay\nThe knocker leads to the first trick. Any card may be led and the other players must always follow suit if they can. Players must also head the trick if they can. This means that if the trick has not been trumped, a player who can follow suit must play a higher card of that suit than any that are in the trick if possible. A player who has no card of the suit led must if possible play a trump that is high enough to beat all trumps that have already been played to the trick. A player who cannot follow suit and has no trumps, or none big enough to beat the highest trump in the trick, may play any card. The player of the highest trump, or if no trumps are played the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick and leads to the next.\nPayments\nThe pool is divided between the players according to the number of tricks they win. Each player receives  1/5 of the pool for each trick won. \nPlayers who play and win zero tricks are andati in bestia (angry). They receive nothing, and they must each pay a stake equal to whole contents of the pool. These stakes go into the pool for the next deal.\nSome special rules apply to the knocker.\n\n      If the knocker wins zero tricks, he must pay a stake equal to one and a half times the contents of the pool towards the pool for the next deal.\nIf the knocker wins more tricks and any one other player, the knocker only has to pay half the normal stake to the pool at the start of the next deal.\n\n      The game ends when all the players have been dealer, or when a majority of the players  want to end it.\nVariations\nTo add variety to the game, some deals may be played under different rules. Sometimes the dealer will propose a variant, and if most of the players agree, it is adopted for that deal. It would of course be possible to play a series of deals or a whole session under any of these rules.\n\nBriscola rubata (stolen trump): \nAfter the deal but before looking at his cards, the dealer can take the turned up trump card and add it to his hand. He then discards a  card of his choice face down. In this case the dealer is not allowed to fold and cannot exchange any other cards. The other players have the opportunity to exchange cards or fold as usual. If none of them knocks, they will each get at least one opportunity to exchange, because the dealer is the last to speak and cannot knock until it is his turn.\nMano a fidarsi (trust hand):\nThe trump card is not revealed until the end of the exchange phase. Some players dont permit any cards to be exchanged in this variant - if you don\'t wish to play with the cards you are dealt your only option is to fold.\nA perdere (negative) \nThe determination of trumps and the card exchange process work as usual, but the player who takes the fewest tricks  wins the pool. Often it is agreed that this game should be played for only a part of the pool. If two or more players tie for fewest tricks they split  (the agreed portion of) the pool equally between them. The knockerfails if he takes more tricks than any other player. In this case  he must pay the agreed amount into the pool, replacing the total amount taken out of the pool by the player(s) with fewest tricks, as well as paying 1.5 times the normal stake for the next deal.\nGiro a tre carte (three card hand) \nInstead of five cards, only 3 cards are dealt to each player. The exchanging, knocking, play and payments work the same way as in the five-card game.\nThree-card hands without folding\nWhen there are five or six players, this variant may be played for a few deals at the start of the session, to build up the pool more quickly. Everyone pays an equal stake to the pool. Three cards each are dealt, and the trump is turned as usual. There is no exchanging, folding or knocking. The player to the right of the dealer leads and the cards are played. If anyone takes two tricks, they retrieve  their stake for that deal from the pool. No one else takes anything from the pool, and the stakes for the next deal are added to it.\nTerzo obligatorio\nIn this variant there must be at least three players in each deal, so when only three players remain folding is no longer an option.\n\nSingle round of knocking\nBestia is often played in such a way that each player has just one opportunity to play or fold and one opportunity to exchange cards. It is convenient if there are five players, because then the amount in the pool is guaranteed always to be divisible by five whatever the basic stake, but there is nothing to prevent 4 or 6 people playing by the same rules if the basic stake is divisible by 5.\nAfter each player has paid a stake to the pool, the dealer deals one card face up to determine the trump suit, then a batch of five cards to each of the other players, and four cards to himself. These four cards together with the turned up trump make up the dealer\'s hand.\nBeginning with the player to dealer\'s right and going round the table anticlockwise, ending with the dealer, each player decides whether to play (which may be indicated by knocking on the table) or fold (which may be indicated by throwing away one\'s cards). A player who chooses to play may immediately discard up to four cards (but not all five) and is dealt an equal number of replacement cards from the pack. If the pack runs out of cards, the cards discarded by previous players are shuffled to make a new pack. After the exchange it is the next player\'s turn to decide whether to play or fold.\nIf all players but one fold, that player simply takes the pool. If more than one player plays, the active player nearest to dealer\'s right leads to the first trick. At the end of the play the players divide the pool between them, taking one fifth of the pool for each trick won. \nAny player who plays but takes no tricks must pay an amount equal to the whole pool (this is called "andare in bestia"). These payments plus the new stakes added by the players form the pool for the next deal.    \nFurther restrictions in the play\nSome play that if the player leading to the first trick holds the ace of trumps, he must lead it. Some extend this to require that if at any stage the player whose turn it is to lead holds the highest remaining trump, that trump must be led to the trick.\nMany play that a player who is unable to follow suit is always obliged to play a trump, even if the trick has already been trumped and the player has no trump high enough to beat the card that is currently winning the trick.\nSome require that when playing a trump, you must announce out lout the card that you are playing.    \nOne player wins the whole pool\nSome play that pool is not divided. Instead, the player who wins most tricks collects the whole pool. So to win the pool you need 3 tricks, or 2 tricks if no other player takes more than one. If there is a tie for most trick (two players take 2 tricks each or no one takes more than one trick), no one wins the pool and it remains in play for the next deal.\nBestia col Buco\nThis variant for four or more players  is played with three-card hands. It is said to be best for six players. After the players have paid their stakes, the dealer deals one card face up on the table to determine the trump suit, and on top of it at right angles places a packet of three cards face down. These are known as the buco. The dealer then deals a batch of three cards to each player, including himself. Beginning to the dealer\'s right, each player has the option to fold ("passare"), to knock ("bussare") indicating that he will play with the three cards he was dealt, or to play "col buco", meaning that he will discard all the cards he was dealt and play with the three cards of the buco instead. A player who looks at the buco is obliged to play - he is not allowed to fold however poor the cards in the buco may be.\nThe play is as usual, the nearest player to dealer\'s right who has not folded leading to the first trick. Players win a third of the pool for each trick they take. Anyone who plays and takes no tricks must pay an amount equal to the whole pool.  \nOther Bestia Web Pages\nThe Italian Wikipedia page on Bestia covers several variants.  \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Trump group > Rams Group > Bestia\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2013.

It was extremely fashionable in Britain in the early 20th century, and was Winston Churchill\'s favourite card game. Although its popularity declined in the late 20th century, it still has many devoted players.\nBezique is a two-player card game, and the basic version is played with a double pack of 64 cards (two copies of A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in each suit). In its heyday, variations for larger numbers of cards were invented. The American game Pinochle is very similar in structure, especially in its two-player form.\nSharon Clarke\'s description of Bezique: The Card Game is published on the BBC web site.\nHere is an archive copy of Chris Herring\'s rules for Six Pack Bezique.\nHoward Fosdick\'s web site has rules of Bezique and Polish Bezique.\nRules of Bezique are available on the Card Game Heaven site.\nJean-Franois Bustarret\'s site has rules in French version for Bsigue.\n\nA shareware Bezique program which supports network and offline play is available from Meggiesoft Games.\nA shareware Bezique program for Windows is available from Games Galore.\nThe Cardmaster package includes a 4-pack Rubicon Bezique computer program.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Ace-Ten Games > Marriage Group > Bezique\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2004.

The aim of the game is to "get away" by playing all of one\'s cards. The last remaining player who fails to get away and is left holding cards is the loser.\nUnfortunately, this game is also known by many players as Bhabhi, which in Hindi means "brother\'s wife". This name, which is  applied to the loser of the game as a mocking insult, is extremely offensive in the context of Punjabi culture. It belongs to a tradition, sadly not yet extinct, in which women were regarded as property and treated with disrespect and cruelty. The game is sometimes known as Bhabhi Thulla, "thulla" being a Hindi slang word for police, applied to a card of a different suit that interrupts the play of a trick.\nPlayers and Cards\nGetaway is played with a standard 52-card pack without jokers. In each suit the cards rank from high to low A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.\nAt least 3 players are needed for the game to be interesting, and up to around 8 people can play. With more than eight, the hands become too small unless one adapts the game by adding a second pack of cards - see variants.\nDeal and play are clockwise.\nDeal\nAny player may deal. The cards are shuffled and dealt out as equally as possible to the players - some players may have one more card than others. The players each pick up their cards and look at them, without showing them to any other player.\nTo even out any advantage or disadvantage of starting with more or fewer cards, I recommend that the players take turns to deal.\nPlay\nFirst trick\nThe player who holds the Ace of Spades begins by playing it face up on the table, and each of the other players must play also a card face up. For convenience, this may be done in clockwise order, but in this first trick it is not strictly necessary for players to wait for their turn before playing. Those players who have a spade must play a spade of their choice; those who have no spades may play any card they wish. When everyone has played one card, these cards are gathered and set aside face down, beginning a waste pile. The player who had the Ace of Spades now begins the second trick by playing any one of  his her remaining cards face up on the table.\nSecond and subsequent tricks\nEach trick is begun by the player of the highest card in the suit that was led to the previous trick: this player is said to "have the power". The player leads any card, placing it face up on the table. Then the other players, in clockwise order, must if possible play a card of the same suit as the card that was led. If they have several cards of the suit they have a free choice which of them to play. A player who has no card of the suit led may play any card. This card of a different suit, sometimes known as a \'tochoo\' or a \'thulla\',  and it  ends the play to that trick. Subsequent players, to the left of the one who played the tochoo, do not get to play a card.\n\nIf everyone  plays a card of the same suit as the card led by the first player, then when all have played one card, these cards are gathered and added face down to the waste pile.\nIf someone was unable to follow suit and played a tochoo, then whoever played the highest card of the suit that was led picks up all the cards played to the trick and adds them to their hand.\n\nIn either case, the player who played the highest card of the suit that was led now "has the power" and begins the next trick by leading any card from hand.\nExample of the beginning of a game between North, East, South and West.\n\nFirst trick: West has the Ace of Spades and plays it, North plays J, East, having no spades, plays A , South plays 10. These four cards are placed face down on the waste pile and since West played the highest spade it is West\'s turn to start the next trick. Note that the cards from the first trick are always thrown on the waste, even if someone is unable to follow suit.\nSecond trick: West plays 5, North 9, East Q, South J. These four cards are thrown on the waste, and East, who played the highest heart, starts the next trick.\nThird trick: East plays 3, South 7, West K, North 8. These four cards are thrown away and West plays next.\nFourth trick: West plays 2, North plays 6, East, who has no more hearts, plays K. This tochoo ends the trick - South does not get a turn to play. The first card was a heart, and the highest heart was played by North, so the three cards of this trick are added to North\'s hand and North plays next. North now has 12 cards, East 9, South 10 and West 9.\nFifth trick: North plays Q, East J, South A, West K, these cards are thrown away and South plays next.\nSixth trick: South plays 5, West, having no more diamonds, plays K. North and East do not get a turn. Since no other player played a card of the suit that South led, South\'s 5 remains the highest card of that suit in the trick, and South must pick up the two cards and lead again. South now has 10 cards, West 7, North 11 and East 8.    \n\nNotes:\n\nIn the first trick, everyone plays one card, even if some player has no spades and therefore throws a card of another suit, and this first trick is always thrown on the waste pile.\nIn the second and subsequent tricks, play must stop if there is a tochoo. If anyone else makes the mistake of playing to the trick after the tochoo, then as a penalty they have to pick up all the cards in the trick and lead next. The same penalty is applied for other mistakes, such as playing out of turn or wrongly playing a tochoo when in fact holding a card of the suit that was led (played first).\n\nGetting away\nAs the game continues, since not everyone plays to every trick and players sometimes have to pick up cards, the players will run out of cards at different times. Players who run out of cards have "got away": they take no more part in the play and are therefore safe from losing. However, it is not possible to get away if you "have the power". If your last card is the highest in a trick in which everyone is able to follow suit, then it is your turn to lead to the next trick but you have no card. In this case you must draw a card at random from the (shuffled) face down waste pile, before the cards from the trick just played are thrown onto the pile. You must  lead the card that you drew to continue the game. If you are lucky, and a higher card of that suit is played to the trick, then you will be out of the game and safe. If no one plays higher in that suit then you will have to lead again, either from the cards you pick up if  there is a tochoo, or otherwise by drawing from the waste pile again. \nTaking cards\nBefore any trick, any player is allowed to take all the cards from the player to their immediate left - or if that player has no cards, the next player in clockwise order who still has cards - and add these cards to their hand. The player whose cards were taken has got away and cannot lose. \nAt first sight it may seem surprising that anyone would wish to do this given that the aim is to get rid of cards. In fact it is often the best move if the player to your left does not have the suits that you have, or has some low cards that you need.\nEnd of Play \nAs players run out of cards they get away and drop out of the game, and the last player left holding cards is the loser. There is no formal scoring system, but if playing a series of games, players may like to keep track of how often each player has lost.\nTwo players\nWhen only two players remain, the play continues as normal. If one of the players plays his or her last card as a tochoo, or the player\'s last card is the same suit and lower than the card played by the other player, then the player who still has cards is the loser. The game descriptions below treat as a special case the situation where player A leads his or her last card, and the opponent B plays a lower card of the same suit. If that was also B\'s last card then A is the loser, but if B still has cards, then A as usual has to draw a card at random from the waste pile (excluding the two cards from the trick just played) and lead it. There are now three possible outcomes:\n\nPlayer B  responds with a higher card of the same suit. In this case player A has got away and player B has lost (even if this was also player B\'s last card).\nPlayer B responds with a lower card of the same suit. If that was player B\'s last card, B has got away and player A loses. If B still has at least one more card, the game continues. A has to draw again from the waste pile (excluding the two cards just played) and lead the drawn card.\nIf B has no card of the suit that A drew, and therefore plays a tochoo, A loses immediately. This is just to save time, because if play were to continue, B would have a sure way to avoid losing. All B has to do is always to play the highest legal card available. In that case A will never be able to give B the lead, and will never be able to get rid of the card on which B played the tochoo, since B will never have a card of this suit.\n\nVariants\nIn some places, instead of dealing the cards to the players, the dealer shuffles the cards and divides them face down piles of roughly equal height, one per player. The dealer is not allowed to  count the number of cards in each pile, but can  transfer cards between piles until they look about equal. Traditionally, the youngest person (usually the child of the family) gets to pick what pile she wants first, which will probably be the pile that looks as though  it might contain the fewest  cards.\nIn some places the whole game is played anticlockwise. In this case, before any trick you can take the cards from the player to your right, who is the next to play after you.\nIn the descriptions I have seen, there are several different versions of the procedure when a player\'s last card is the highest played to a trick and everyone follows suit to the trick.\n\nAs in the description above, the player draws a card from the waste pile (excluding the most recent trick) and leads it.\nInstead of  drawing a card from the waste pile, the player who is due to lead may draw one card at random from the hand of the next player to the left who has cards (or alternatively from any  other player).\nWhen there are more than two players, then playing your last card allows you to get away, even if you should have been next to lead. The lead passes to the next player to the left who still has card. However, if there is only one other player in the game, you do not get away. You must draw from the waste pile and lead as in the main description above.\n\nWith a large number of players the game can be played with a double pack of cards, and some rules will then be needed to deal with duplicates. I suggest that one of the Aces of Spades should be marked, and the holder of the marked Ace of Spades played first. If there is a tie between two players for the highest card of the suit that was led, I suggest that the first played card should count as higher. It is the player of this first of equally high cards who has to pick up the cards if there is a tochoo, and in any case lead to the next trick.\nOther websites and software\nBhabhi.org offers a fairly primitive online game against computer players, and now also an online game against live players. \nZymbiotic offers a Bhabhi game for iPhone, playable against live or computer opponents.\nMark Klassen has posted a description of Bhabhi on BoardGameGeek.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Inflation Games > Getaway\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2013.

The other suits ranks ace (high), king, queen, jack, 10, 9 - except that the suit which is the same colour of trumps has no jack. When the bid is \'no trumps\', all four suits rank A-K-Q-J-10-9. In some versions of Bid Euchre, the nines, or the nines and tens are omitted from the deck.\n\nUsually a double deck is used - containing two of each card. When two identical cards are played to the same trick, the first to be played beats the second.\n\nDeal\n\nAll the cards are dealt out equally to the players.\n\nBidding\n\nEach player has just one opportunity to bid, starting with the player to the left of the dealer, going around the table clockwise, and ending with the dealer. A bid is a number of tricks (one or more), which the bidding side contracts to win if they are allowed to chose trumps, and a proposed trump suit or \'no trump\' - for example \'4 spades\' or \'5 no trump\'. At your turn you must either pass or bid a larger number of tricks than the previous bid if any. There is no rank among the suits, so it is not possible to outbid a bid in one suit with an equal number of tricks in another suit (this is unlike 500 or Bridge).\n\nIn some versions there are additional bids to play alone; in which case your partner puts his or her cards face down and takes no part in the play. Sometimes these lone bids allow you to exchange some cards with partner. In this case the bidder discards the relevant number of cards face down and the bidder\'s partner passes an equal number of cards face down to the bidder to replace them. Both players must decide which cards to pass before seeing the cards passed by the other.\n\nPlay\n\nThe highest bidder is declarer and the trump suit is the suit named in the bid. The high bidder leads to the first trick. The rules of play are as in Euchre - you must follow suit, and if void of the suit led you may trump or discard at will. The left bower(s) count for all purposes as belonging to the trump suit. In double deck versions the first played of two equal cards beats the second.\n\nScoring\n\nIf the bidding side win at least as many tricks as they bid, each side scores one point for each trick they won. \n\nIf the bidding side fail to make as many tricks as they bid they are set, and lose a number of points equal to the number of tricks they bid. The other side still score one point for each trick they won. It is possible for a team\'s overall score to be negative.\n\nGames are played to a target score. A team wins if at the end of a hand in which they succeed in a bid, or defeat the opponents\' bid, their score is equal to or above the target. You cannot win by reaching the target by means of odd tricks made as the opponents of a successful bid. If you reach the target in this way, the game continues until either team fulfills the winning condition.\n\nSpecific Versions of Bid Euchre\nBid Euchre in Barrie, Ontario, Canada\n\nJohn D\'Ambrosio contributed this version from Barrie, a small city 100 km north of Toronto.\n\nThe game is played with 2 decks using the J Q K A only, that is 32 cards in all, so each of the 4 players is dealt 8 cards.\n\nYou can bid any number of a suit or no trump up to a maximum of 8. You can also bid to take all 8 tricks alone, calling for 1 or 2 cards, which you exchange with your partner as described in the general rules above. A bid to play alone is higher than a bid with a partner, and a bid calling for one card is higher than a bid calling for two. The highest bid of all is moon, in which you have to win all 8 tricks alone using the cards you were dealt.\n\nThe scores for playing alone are:\n\ncall for 2 cards: 12 points\ncall for 1 card: 18 points\nmoon: 24 points\n\nYou win this amount if you take all 8 tricks and lose an equal amount if you fail. \n\nThe game is 52 points. There are two versions:\n\nthe winners are the first team who achieve a score of 52 or more points at the end of a hand on which they won a bid;\nthe winners are the first team to reach a score 52 or more points, irrespective of whether they finish by winning a bid.\n\nDouble Deck Bid Euchre from the mid-western USA\n\nThis version was contributed by Craig Powers\n\n48 cards are used: A K Q J 10 9 from two decks mixed together. It is played between two teams of two, with partners facing each other.\n\nPlay and scoring are as in the general rules. Bids are any number up to 12 in a suit or \'no trump\'. In this version the bidding does not end after the first round, but continues for as many rounds as necessary. The bidding ends when no one wants to bid higher, or when 12 (the maximum) is reached, or someone \'goes it alone\'. Passing does not prevent you from bidding at a later turn in the auction. \n\nThe highest bid of all is to \'go it alone\'. This terminates the bidding, and you have to take all 12 tricks by yourself (your partner sits it out).  If you make it you get 24 points, if you fail (even by one trick) you get negative 24 points.  When going alone, before the play starts you have the option of discarding up to 3 cards and accepting replacement cards that your partner chooses to pass to you. \n\nHoosier Bid Euchre\n\nThis version from Indiana, USA was contributed by Paul J. Welty\n\nThe deck is 40 cards: 2 decks of A-K-Q-J-10. It is usually played by 4 people, partners sitting opposite each other. The target score for winning the game is 32.\n\nEach person is dealt 10 cards. Bid and play as in the general rules; bids are any number of tricks from 1 to 10 in a suit or "no trump". A bid of 10 is called "shooting the moon" and is worth 16 points rather than 10, won or lost. Above this is a bid to "shoot the moon alone". The bidder\'s partner does not take part and the bidder alone has to win all 10 tricks. Shooting the moon alone is worth 32 points. \n\nThere is a 3-player variation, using 32 cards: 2 decks of A-J. 10 cards are dealt as usual, but there are 2 left over cards called the kitty. The player who bids highest picks up the kitty cards without showing them to the other players and discards any two cards face down in their place, before leading to the first trick.\n\nOther numbers of people may play by adjusting the deck size so that each gets 10 cards.\n\nBid Euchre with a kitty\nThis version, from Kokomo, Indiana, was reported by Nick Long.\nIt is played with 48 cards: 2 decks of A-K-Q-J-10-9. There are four players, partners sitting opposite each other. Eleven cards are dealt to each player, and four cards are dealt face down into a kitty in the centre of the table.  Each player bids, starting with the player left of the dealer.  Bids are from one to eleven tricks and name the suit you wish to make trump; or you can call no trump high (cards rank from ace down to 9 in each suit) or no trump low (the ranks are inverted - from high to low: 9-10-J-Q-K-A). The high bidder picks up the kitty without showing it and discards four cards face down. The highest possible bid - above 11 tricks - is a shooter, in which the bidder undertakes to win all the tricks playing alone - this is worth 22 points. It should be agreed before the start of the game whether a player who bids a shooter gets the kitty; also whether a shooter can discard two cards and receive replacement cards from partner. The game is usually played to a target of 52 points.\nCutthroat Euchre\n\nTerry Detrie reports that during his four years at Purdue University (W. Lafayette, IN), he played a version of bid Euchre that was simply called "Cutthroat Euchre". It was played by 3 players using 24 cards: one deck with A, K, Q, J, 10, 9 in each suit.  Seven cards were dealt to each player, leaving 3 cards in the kitty.  The rest of the game was the same as the 3 player version of Hoosier Bid Euchre described above (including shooting the moon - a bid of 7 - being worth 16 points).\n\nBid Euchre\n\nThis version is from Shawn\'s Bid Euchre Page, formerly at http://www.erols.com/shawncoons/bid.htm but now disappeared.\n\nThe deck is 32 cards: 2 decks of A-K-Q-J. There are 4 players, who are dealt 8 cards each.\n\nThe minimum bid is 3 tricks with a trump suit. It is possible to bid no trump, but the minimum no trump bid is 5 tricks. \n\nIt is possible to bid 7 alone or 8 alone in any suit or no trump. A bid of 7 alone ranks between the normal bids of 7 and 8, and a bid of 8 alone beats a normal bid of 8. No cards are exchanged with partner.\n\n7 alone scores 14 points for the partnership if successful, and loses 14 if set. 8 alone wins 16 if successful and loses 16 if set. The target score is 32.\n\nBid Euchre, also known as 6 card Euchre, or Racehorse\n\nThis version is from Matt Schemmel and Erin O\'Neil\'s Euchre Home Page\n\nThis can be played by 4 people using a 24 card deck (A-K-Q-J-10-9), or by 6 or 8 using a double deck of 48 cards. There are two equal sized teams, sitting alternately (each player is between two opponents). All the cards are dealt, so 4 or 8 players get 6 cards each; 6 players get 8 cards each. \n\nBids name a number of tricks, but not a trump suit. The minimum bid is 3. The dealer is allowed to equal the highest bid so far, rather than bidding higher. If everyone else passes, the dealer must bid at least 3. \n\nThe highest bidder names a trump suit, or \'no trump, high\' or \'no trump, low\'. \'No trump, high\' is a normal no trump game; in \'no trump, low\' the cards rank in reverse order: 9(high), 10, J, Q, K, A(low) in each suit.\n\nThe target score is 32 points.\n\nScott Alber\'s Bid Euchre\n\nThis is played by 4 players in fixed partnerships using a 40 card deck - two each of A-K-Q-J-10 in each suit. A bidder can choose to play with a trump suit, or in no trumps with aces high, or in no trumps with reversed card ranking (aces low). The minimum bid is 1 trick and if the first three players pass dealer must bid. \n\nHigher than a bid of ten tricks is a bid to "shoot the moon", in which the bidder offers to win all ten tricks playing alone, having received one or two cards from partner. It can only be overcalled by the dealer also offering also to "shoot the moon". The player shooting the moon announces trumps and then asks for either one or two cards. Partner decides what cards to pass; the bidder takes these and then discards and equal number of cards so as to have a hand of 10 cards.\n\nThe play is according to the normal rules, with the first of equal cards beating the second, and the ranking of cards reversed if the bid was "low". Scoring is as usual, shooting the moon being worth 15 points if two cards were passed and 15 if only one card was passed.\n\nThe first team to reach 52 or more points wins.  If both teams reach 52 or more in the same hand, the team who won the bid wins the game. \n\n\n\n\nBooks\nKevin Easley and Bob Baiyor\'s The Think System: A Light-Hearted Guide to Serious Double Deck Bid Euchre explains the game and its strategy, concentrating on a 48-card version played in Indiana.\n\nSoftware\nWith Malcolm Bain\'s Bid Euchre Program for Windows, you can play Bid Euchre against computer opponents.\nHere are John Ratliff\'s Bid Euchre Rules, and his freeware Bid Euchre Program for Windows, Mac OS-X or Linux with which you can play this version against three computer players.\nYou can download a freeware Bid Euchre / Pepper program from Thanos Card Games.\nOther Euchre-like games with bidding\n\nThe game Pepper, played in Iowa, USA, is a really a kind of Bid Euchre, but with the possibility of more than one round of bidding, and some differences in the scoring.\n\nFive Hundred is a more elaborate bidding game based on Euchre; it originated and is still played in the USA, but has become the national game of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Trump group > Euchre Group > Bid Euchre\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2003.

It is played with a standard 52 card deck plus 2 jokers, for a total of 54 cards. The two jokers must be distinct: one is called the big joker and the other is the little joker. There are 4 players consisting of two teams of two; each player sits opposite their partner. The game starts with each team at zero, and the object of the game is to reach a score 7 or more points, or force the other team to go negative 7 or more points. Points are scored by bidding for and winning tricks, which in this game are called books.\nThe Deal\n\nWhen the game first starts, the deck is shuffled and dealt around, and the person that draws the first diamond becomes the first dealer. Cards are dealt one at a time in a clockwise order. Each player is to receive 12 cards for a total of 48 cards. During the deal, six cards are to be placed face down in the centre of the table to form a kitty. The first four cards and the last four cards cannot be put in the kitty; apart from this the dealer can deal the kitty cards at any stage during the deal, either singly or several at one time.\n\n\nAfter each hand, the turn to deal  passes to the left. \nThe Bidding\n\nThe turn to bid goes around the table only once starting with the player to the left of the dealer. Each bid consists of a number from 3 to 7, and a suffix "uptown", "downtown", or "no trump".\n\nThe number indicates the number of books above 6 that the bidder\'s team will contract to win - for example a bid of 5 is a promise to win at least 11 books (6 + 5). As there are 13 books in all, 7 is the highest possible bid. \n\nUptown (or "high") means you intend to name a trump suit, and that high cards will win.\n\nDowntown (or "low") means that you intend to name a trump suit, and that low cards will win. \nNo Trump means that there will be no trump, and that if you win the bidding you will then determine whether high or low cards will have preference.\n\n\nEach player in turn must either pass or name a bid which is higher than the previous bid. A bid of a higher number outranks a bid of a lower number, and a bid in no trumps outranks a bid of the same number uptown or downtown. Bids of the same number uptown and downtown are equal to each other - neither can be bid over the other. Therefore, the possible bids, from lowest to highest, are as follows:\n\n3 Uptown or 3 Downtown\n3 No Trump\n4 Uptown or 4 Downtown\n4 No Trump\n5 Uptown 5 Downtown\n5 No Trump\n6 Uptown or 6 Downtown\n6 No Trump\n7 Uptown or 7 Downtown\n7 No Trump\n\n\nNote that when you bid intending to name a trump suit, you indicate the direction you are bidding (uptown or downtown), but you do not name which suit you intend to name as trumps until you win the bidding. On the other hand when bidding a no trump, you do not indicate which direction (uptown or downtown), until you win the bid.\n\nIf the first three players pass, the dealer is forced to bid. Since there is no advantage in bidding more than the minimum 3, the dealer in this case will normally bid 3 uptown, 3 downtown or 3 no trump.\nThe Play\n\nThe highest bidder names the trump suit, or in the case of a no trump bid specifies whether it will be played uptown or downtown. The bidder then picks up the 6 card kitty and throws away six cards. The cards thrown away can come from the bidder\'s dealt hand, the original kitty, or any combination of these. The six cards which are thrown away are placed face down in front of the bidder and count as the first book won by the bidder\'s side.\n\nThe bidder then leads the first card. Any card may be led, and the other players must follow the suit led, if they have it in their hand. A player who does not have the led suit in their hand has the option to play a trump or play a different suit. A trump always beats any non-trump cards played in the book. If there is more than one trump played, then the highest ranking trump based on the type of bid taken will win the book. If no one plays a trump, then the highest ranking card to the suit led wins the book. The winner of each book leads to the next.\n\nThe ranking of the cards within the suits depends on the bid. The rankings from high to low are as follows:\n\nUptown trumps: Big joker, little joker, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nUptown non-trump suits: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nDowntown trumps: Big joker, little joker, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K.\nDowntown non-trump suits: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K.\n\n\nIf the bid is no trumps, all the suits are non-trump suits. In this case the jokers are of no value, and cannot win a book. They can be played if you have no card of the suit led. In the unusual case where a player leads a joker, the next player may play any card, and the first card played which is not a joker determines the suit that must be followed in that book. The highest card played of this suit wins the book.\n\nRenege: If a person fails to follow suit when they have a card of that suit in their hand, this is called a renege. When this occurs, 3 books won by the reneging team in that hand are given to the non-reneging team. If the reneging team won fewer than three books, the hand is scored as though the non-reneging team won all 13 books.\nScoring\n\nEach team begins with a score of zero. At the end of each hand, the bidding team either wins or loses some points. The game ends when a team wins by achieving a cumulative score of seven or more, or loses by reaching a cumulative score of minus seven or worse.\n\nAt the end of the play, the books are counted. There are 13 altogether, corresponding to the 12 cards played by each player plus the kitty, which counts as a book won by the bidder\'s team. Each book won above six counts as a point. In order to score, the bidding team must make at least as many points as they bid. \n\nIf the bidding team have at least as many points as their bid, they score all the points they made. If they fail to take enough books for their bid, they score nothing for their books, and instead the points that they bid are subtracted from their score. In either case, the opponents of the bidding team neither win nor lose any points.\n\n\nExample: If my team won the bid with a "5 high", and we only made 4 points (the kitty and 9 other books) we would have failed our bid and we would go back 5 points. On the other hand if we make 6 books (the kitty plus 11 other books) on our 5 bid, we will score a total of 6 points for that hand.\n\nIf the winning bid was a no trump bid, the score for the hand is doubled. For example if you win the bid with 4 no trump and win 11 books you score 10 points (which will win the game unless you began the hand with a negative score); if you win only 8 books you lose 8 points. \nVariations\n\nSome play that, in a no trump bid, the jokers must be placed out of play in the kitty. If you win the bid in no trumps, then any jokers you find in the kitty must be left there, and you must discard any jokers that were in your original hand. After you have discarded (placing any jokers apart from your other discards), then before the play begins, any other players who hold jokers must discard them and draw new cards in their place from the face-down kitty.\n\nSome play that in no trump bids, jokers can be played at any time, even if you have a card of the suit that was led, but the joker can never win the trick. If you play this variation, you can sometimes use a joker profitably to lengthen one of your suits.\n\nSome play that the minimum bid is 4 - no 3-bids are allowed.\n\n\nMany people play that a  low bid with trumps has priority over a high bid of the same number with trumps. For example if one player bids 4 high, the next player can overcall with 4 low. On the other hand, some play that all bids for a given number of tricks are equal - so for example to overcall a 4 bid of any kind requires a 5 bid or higher.\n\nSome play that if the bidding is won by a bid with trumps, the kitty must be sported before it is added to the bidder\'s hand. Sporting the kitty means that after a player wins the bid they expose the kitty, so that  all can see what cards are in it. \nSome players play with only one joker, and therefore only five cards in the kitty.\n\nSome players play with only one joker, but use the deuce of spades as permanent second highest trump in the game. In this case there is only a five card kitty, and the spade suit is shorter than the others, the two counting as part of the trump suit. In no trump bids, the two of spades resumes its normal function as a spade.\n\nSome players play with both jokers and with the deuce of spades as the third highest trump in the game. In this case there is a six card kitty.\n\n  Some play that if the bidder\'s opponents win more than six books, they score for each book above six that they make: 1 point for each book over 6 if there was a trump suit; 2 for each book over six if there were no trumps.\n\nA bid of seven (uptown, downtown or no trumps) is also known as a Boston. Some award extra points for this - in theory quadruple points (28) are awarded. In practice this means that whole game is at stake: the bidders will win the game if they succeed in winning all trhe books, and the oppopnents will win the game if they win any books at all.\n\n\n52 card Bid Whist\n\nHoward Ship and Rob Simons describe a version of Bid Whist played in the North-East USA with only 52 cards and no jokers, so that the kitty consists of only four cards. \n\n\nAs usual, the bid is the number of \'books\' above six that the team promises to take, but in this version the bids are numbers only, from 1 to 7. Note that bids of 1 and 2 are possible. As in the game with jokers, each player has just one chance to speak, and must either pass or bid a number. For the first three players, each bid must be higher than the previous bid if any. The dealer may take the bid from the highest bidder so far by matching the current high bid; the dealer may even take the bid from partner in this way. If the first three players pass, the dealer may either bid  1 or gather the cards, reshuffle and deal again. \n\nExceptionally, if any player, \n  including the dealer, has no face cards (kings, queens or jacks - aces are not considered face \n  cards) they may, at their turn to bid, call for a redeal instead of bidding. The cards are then shuffled and dealt again by the same dealer. A player who has already passed or bid can no longer  demand a redeal.\n\nThe winner of the bidding names a trump suit or specifies "no trump", and chooses one of the three possibilities for the card ranking: \n\nUptown, in which every suit ranks from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nDowntown, aces good, in which every suit ranks from high to low: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K.\nDowntown, aces bad, in which every suit ranks from high to low: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A.\n\nAfter choosing trumps and ranking, the bidder takes the four cards from the kitty and discards four cards in their place. The discarded kitty belongs not to the bidder but to the winner of the first trick. Thus the first trick is worth two books. \n\nThere are no negative scores:\n\nIf the bidding team makes their bid, they score the number of books actually taken less six.  Taking 11 books on a bid of four would score 5 points.\nIf the bidding team is stopped, the opposing team scores the amount bid.  With a bid of 4, the opposing team only needs to take 4 books to stop the bidding team (the bidding team would then take the remaining 9 books, missing their goal of 10), and the opposing team would score 4 points.\n\nNo trump bids score the same as bids with a trump suit - there is no doubling in this version. \n\nThe first team to score 21 or more points wins.\n\nThe lowest bids, 1 and 2, are rather easy to win, and therefore the bidding almost always reaches 3 or more. Therefore it is normal for the first two players to use the low bids as signals:\n\n1 for a mixed hand (some high cards, some low cards)\n2 for a \'downtown\' hand (mostly low cards)\n3 for an \'uptown\' hand (mostly high cards)\n\n\nVariations of 52-card Bid Whist\n Daniel Parr of Oregon describes a variant from Boston. There is no kitty. Bids are numbers representing the number of tricks in excess of 6 that the team is contracted to win. Bidding begins at 1 and each bid must be higher than the last. The auction continues as many times as necessary around the table until three players have passed. A player who has passed cannot take any further part in the auction. If the first three players pass the dealer is  forced to "eat" a bid of one.  The \n  player who wins the contract (including when the dealer eats it) \ndetermines trump by leading it. No trump may also be declared. There is no downtown option.  If the partnership who won the auction made their contract, \n  they win as many points as they won tricks above 6. (In this variant, as in classic whist, tricks are not called "books" but instead the first 6 tricks are known as the "book".) If the bidding \n  partnership was set, they lose as many points as they contracted. If the \n  partnership who did not win the contract makes any tricks, they win as \nmany points as tricks.  The first team that reaches 11 points wins; if both teams reach or pass 11 points the team that won the contract wins. This version is often played in rubbers, the rubber going to the first team that wins two games.\nTom W reports a version without a kitty played in Cincinnati, Ohio. Everyone is dealt 13 cards. Downtown bids are known as "special", and the bids specify whether the player wants to play a normal (uptown) game, a special (downtown) game or no trump. A special bid outranks a normal bid for the same number of tricks, and no trump is highest, so the bids in ascending order are: 1, 1 special, 1 no, 2, 2 special, 2 no, and so on.\nChevee Todd describes a version called Trumps played in Hawaii. There is a 4-card kitty but no downtown option. The bids are numbers, from 3 to 7, and the winner of the bidding announces the trump suit or no trump. The significance of the number bids is as usual, but they are explained differently: subtract the bid from 8 to get the number of tricks the bidder\'s opponents need to set the contract. Apparently the bidding team wins 1 point if they succeed and the opponents score 2 otherwise. A team wins if they are 7-0 up, or have a lead of 11 points, or have at least 21 points with the other team at least  2 points behind. This must make for a very long game - typically around 20-30 deals would need to be played.

It is popular in the province of New Brunswick, on the Atlantic coast of Canada. It is said to be a French Acadian game. In French it sometimes known  as Deux Cents (200) and sometimes as Dix or Bidder 10 (Tens). Versions played in Quebec are also known as Le Rough or Le Ruff  and around the eastern townships La Bloutte or La Fouine. There are some players in neighbouring Maine, USA, for example in Fort Kent, where the game is called La Bloute, and I have received two reports  from as far away as Alberta where it is called Tens or Barouche. The only book descriptions of versions of this game that I have been able to find are in Culbertson\'s Hoyle (1950) under the name \'Chinese Bridge (four-hand)\', and in French under the name \'Le Ruff\' in Richard Raymond\'s Rgles des Jeux de Cartes st des Patiences (2nd ed 2006) credited to Marie-Anna Bois of Quebec.\nThe age and origins of 200 are uncertain, but it is likely to have originated in Canada. It is best known in New Brunswick, where several correspondents say that it has been played for at least 3 or 4 generations, so clearly it was already known there in the 1930\'s or earlier. It is closely related to Rook, a game with special cards played in the Midwest USA and Canada. It seems likely either that Rook, which was first published by Parker Brothers in 1906, was  based on 200, or that the games had a common ancestor. 200 also has some similarity to a group of Chinese games known as Sheng Ji of which 100 is a typical example. However, it is hard to establish a convincing historical connection with the Chinese games, and the resemblance may be coincidental.\nThere are many variations. I will first describe what seems to be the standard form for four players in partnerships using 36 cards and playing to a target score of 200 (after which the game is named). Less serious players very often use 40 cards and play with a 4-card kitty. In the northern part of New Brunswick, the target score is often raised to 300 or 500 for a longer game. There are also versions for 2, 5 and 6 players.\nPlayers and Cards\n200 is generally agreed to be best for four players in partnerships - North and South play against East and West. In the variations section, versions for six, five and two players are described.\nFor the 4-player game without a kitty, a 36-card pack is created by removing all the 2\'s, 3\'s, 4\'s, 6\'s from a standard 52-card pack without jokers. The cards in each suit rank from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-5.\nWhen playing with a kitty, or with more than 4 players, more additional cards may be used - see variations.\nIn all forms of the game, the cards have point values as follows:\n\n\neach ace: 10 points   \n each ten: 10 points\n each five: 5 points\n other cards: 0 points\n\n\nso that there are 100 card points in the deck altogether.\nThe dealing, bidding and play are all clockwise.\nDeal\nThe first dealer is chosen at random. For example, a player can shuffle the deck and deal single cards face up to the players starting with the player on the left. The first player who receives a jack is the first dealer. After each hand, the turn to deal passes to the left. Before each deal, the cards are shuffled by the dealer and cut by the opponent to dealer\'s right. The dealer then deals 9 cards face down to each player, in batches of three, starting with the player to dealer\'s left.\nBidding\nPlayers now bid for the right to choose which suit will be trumps, each bid representing the number of points the bidder\'s partnership contracts to take in tricks if not outbid.\nThe player to the left of the dealer speaks first, and the bidding continues clockwise. The minimum bid is 50, all bids must be multiples of 5, and each bid must be higher than the last. A player who does not wish to bid can pass, but having passed cannot bid again in that auction.\nIf all four players pass, the hands are thrown in without score and the next dealer deals. If there is a bid, the bidding continues for as many circuits as necessary until three players have passed, or until somone bids 100, the highest possible bid.\nThe final (and highest) bidder becomes the contractor, and announces which suit will be trump for that hand.\nNote: it is not necessary for the first bidder to begin at the minimum 50 - the initial bid can be as high as you like.\nPlay\nHaving announced the trump suit, the contractor leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if able to. A player who has no card of the suit led is free to play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or, if it contains no trumps, by the highest card of the suit that was led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nThe objective is to win tricks that contain card points (Aces, 10\'s and 5\'s). Tricks without points have no value.\nIf the contractor fails to announce a trump suit before leading to the first trick, the suit of the first card played by the contractor automatically becomes trump.\nPlaying a trump when you have no card of the non-trump suit that was led is known as "cutting", no doubt from the French "couper", which means to trump in a card game, but also literally "to cut". There is no obligation to try to win the trick or to cut when you are unable to follow suit - it is legal to discard from another suit. Indeed if you expect your partner to win the trick you will probably want to discard a ten or five that might otherwise have been lost to the opponents.\nCompleted tricks are stored face down in front of a member of the team that won them and may not be looked at again by anyone until the end of the play.\nScoring\nScores are kept on paper. Each team begins with a score of zero.\nWhen all the cards have been played, each team counts the value of the point cards in their tricks. If the contractor\'s team has at least as many card points as the final bid, the total value of the cards in their tricks is added to their cumulative score. If the number of card points they took is less than the bid, the amount of the bid is subtracted from their cumulative score.\nThe opposing team add whatever card points they took in tricks to their cumulative score, with one exception: if the contractor\'s opponents currently have a cumulative score of 100 or more, then they can score for points in their tricks only if at least one member of their team bid during the auction. If they both passed at their first opportunity to speak, they score nothing for the points in their tricks.\nExample: Scores are NS:120, EW:100. NS bid 75.\n\nIf NS take 85 card points, their new score is 205 and they win the game.\nIf NS take 75 card points, their new score is 195. If East or West bid they score their 25 points for a cumulative score of 125; if they both just passed their score stays at 100.\nIf NS take 70 card points they lose the 75 they bid and their score is now 45. EW can score their 30 points provided that one of them bid for a total of 130; if both just passed their score stays at 100.\n\nA team\'s cumulative score can be negative. On the score sheet this is usually shown by drawing a box around the number - for example minus 95 is written as 95. The team is said to be "in the box", or sometimes "in the hole" (shown by a circle rather than a box around the score). Failing in a contract is sometimes known as being "boxed".\nThe first team to achieve a score of 200 points or more wins the game. If both teams reach 200 or more on the same deal then the bidding team wins.\nThe game also ends if one team reaches a negative score of 200 or worse while the other team\'s score is positive or zero. In that case the team with minus 200 or worse loses the game.\nVariations\nMany of these variations are extremely widespread, although some experts dislike those that increase the luck element of the game. Most informal games are played with a kitty and with the 100 for 200 bid. Allowing the dealer to keep the bid is also very common.\n200 with a Kitty\nProbably most non-tournament games of 200 are played with a kitty. The kitty is a face down packet of four cards that can be used by the contractor to improve his or her hand. This introduces an element of uncertainty and tends to lead to higher bids.\nIn this variant, a 40-card pack is used, including the sixes. Cards in each suit rank from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5. Nine cards are dealt to each player and four face card down to a central "kitty". The usual method of dealing is: a batch of three cards to each player; two to the kitty; three to each player; two to the kitty; three to each player.\nAfter the usual bidding process, the high bidder takes the four kitty cards without showing them and discards four cards face down in exchange before naming trumps. The cards discarded can include some or all of the cards obtained from the kitty. No one is allowed to look at these discarded cards until the end of the play - even the contractor cannot look at them after the first card has been led. The play the proceeds as usual, and any points in the discarded cards count for the contractor\'s opponents at the end of the play. Scoring is as usual.\nThere are several variations concerning the contractor\'s four-card discard and how it is counted.\n\nThe most usual rule, as given above, is that any cards can be discarded, no one can look at the discard, and that any points in it count to the contractor\'s opponents.\nSome play that any trumps that are discarded must be shown to the other players after trumps are announced and before the play begins.\nSome play that any points in the discard count for the side that wins the last trick.\nA few players award the points in the discard to the side that wins the first trick, but the discard still cannot be looked at until the end of the play.\nSome players do not allow any point cards (aces, tens or fives) to be discarded. This could rarely lead to an impossible situation if the contractor had 10 or more of the 12 point cards among the 13 cards held after picking up the kitty.\nSome players do not allow trumps or point cards to be discarded. There is a greater chance of this leading to an impossible situation, since there are now 19 cards that cannot be discarded, and it is quite conceivable that the contractor could hold 10 of these.\nSome players require the contractor to inform the other players if there are any point cards in the discard.\nSome count the discarded points for the contractor. This changes the tactics, allowing the contractor to save tens and fives simply by discarding them. Naturally this leads to higher bids.\n\n100 for 200\nThis bid, known as "cent pour deux cents" in French, or sometimes as "two for one", is allowed in most informal games. It is the highest bid, and commits the contractor\'s team to win all 100 points in tricks. They score 200 points if successful, thus winning the game unless they were in the hole (box) when they bid it. If a bid of 100 for 200 fails, the contractor\'s team loses just 100 points (and as usual the opponents score the points they make provided that either they have bid or their score is below 100).\n100 to win the game\nSome play that if the bidders take 100 points in their tricks, they win the whole game, irrespective of the bid or the previous scores. This is known as a bloutte, and gives its name to this version of the game. If a team takes 100 card points while losing one zero-point trick, this is known as a chienne (bitch), and winning 100 points while losing two empty tricks is a double chienne. The result is the same, but a chienne or double chienne is considered more embarassing for the losers.\nKeeping\nIn this widespread variation, the dealer is allowed to equal the highest bid so far, rather than bidding higher. The dealer would say "I keep the bid". Example: North deals, East passes, South bids 60, West bids 75, North "keeps" 75, East cannot bid, having already passed, South passes. If West passes now, North is the contractor and the bid is 75. Alternatively West might bid 80, and North would then have the option of "keeping" 80 or passing, and so on.\nWhen keeping is allowed, a bid of 100 (or 100 for 200) by a player other than the dealer does not automatically end the auction. The dealer still has the right to keep the 100 bid.\nOne correspondent describes an unusual variation of this where any player can keep (not just the dealer), but you cannot keep a bid that has already been kept. So the bidding might start: East "50", South "keep 50", West "55", North "keep 55", East "60", South "65", West "pass", North "pass", East "keep 65" and so on. West cannot keep 50 in the first round of bidding since 50 has already been kept by South; similarly East cannot keep 55.\nDealer must bid after three passes\nMany people do not allow all four players to pass. If the first three players pass the dealer is forced to become the contractor and bid 50. This rule is commonly found in 200 with a kitty, where after three passes, with the help of the kitty the dealer has good chances of success.\nSingle Round Bidding\nIn some groups each player only gets one chance to bid, the dealer speaking last. Those who play this variation usually allow the dealer to keep.\nWith single round bidding, some play that when the first three players pass, the declarer simply becomes the contractor, with the right to use the kitty if any and name trump, without bidding. In this case the contractor\'s team cannot lose points, though the opponents might score more than them. If the first two players pass, then in this variation the third player should bid if at all possible, to stop the dealer getting the contract for nothing.\nDenis Landry reports that in some parts of Qubec (near the Eastern Townships), the game is played under the name "Bloutte" (spelling uncertain) with single round bidding and a target score of 100 to win the game.\nTarget score of 300 or 500\nIn the northern part of New Brunswick, it is normal to play to a target score of 300 or 500 points to win the game, rather than 200.\nIn this case, the threshhold beyond which you are "required to bid" in order to score points against the contractor is set at 100 points below the target. The idea is that it should not be possible to win a game on a hand where your team did not bid in the auction.\n\nWhen the target is 300 points, you can score points without having bid only if your score at the start of the hand is 195 or less.\nWhen the target is 500 points, you can score points without having bid only if your score at the start of the hand is 395 or less.\n\nSome players require a team to have bid at least 60 to qualify for points when they are at or above the "required to bid" threshhold. A bid of just 50 or 55 does not qualify.\nThe amount you have to be "in the hole" (or box) to lose (provided that the other team is not also in the hole) is normally set equal to the target. For example with a target of 500, if one team goes 500 points \'in the hole\', the other team wins, if their score is 0 or higher.\nSome play that you need 500 to win the game, but you lose if you are 300 in the hole. No doubt there are many other local variations on these target numbers.\nOther scoring variations\nSome play that if both teams reach the target score on the same deal, the team with the higher score wins - not the bidding team. It\'s unclear what happens in this version if the scores are equal - for example 210:210. Perhaps another deal is played to decide the winners.\nSome play that the game can only be won by winning a bid. So if a hand results in the contractor\'s opponents reaching 200 or more while the contractor\'s team is still below 200 after adding the score for their successful bid, the game is not over - further hands must be played. The game ends only when a contractor\'s bid is successful AND after scoring the contractor\'s team have a cumulative score of 200 or more.\nSome play that if a team wins while the other team is in the hole (below zero), this is considered a skunk - equivalent to winning two games. Others use the term skunk for the case where the losers neither won nor lost any points, so the game is won in two deals, 200 to zero.\nIn place of the rule that a team that is within 100 of the target if a target score cannot score points unless they bid, some play the following version. A team that is within 50 (or other agreed amount) of the target score cannot score unless they actually win the bidding and play the contract or defeat (box) the contractor. This makes it impossible for both teams to reach or pass the target in the same deal.\nNumber of cards\nSome play with hands of 10 cards each - so all the cards down to 5 are used for the game without a kitty, and if playing with a kitty the 4\'s are included as well. Denis Landry reports that the 10-card game (without a kitty) is more usual in South-East New Brunswick. In North-East New Brunswick, 200 is usually played with 9-card hands.\nAnother rarely played version is with 12-card hands and a kitty, using a full 52-card deck for four players.\nMinimum bid\nWhen playing variations that are favourable to the contractor, such as 200 with a kitty, some set the minimum bid higher, for example at 65 or higher.\nOn the other hand, the game \'Le Ruff\' as described in Richard Raymond\'s book, there is no minimum bid, though it is said that bids below 35 are unusual. If the first  three players pass, the dealer simply becomes the contractor and chooses trumps, with no minimum points requirement.\nNo Trump Contract\nSome allow the bidder to announce a no trump (sans atout) game in which there is no trump suit. No trump games score double: the bidding team score twice the number of points they took if they are successful and lose twice the amount bid if they fail. Their opponents score twice the value of the cards in the tricks that they take.\nCompulsory trump lead\nSome play that the first card led by the contractor determines the trump suit, and thus do not allow a non-trump to be led to the first trick.\nDeal variations and Misdeal\nSome prefer to deal the cards one or two at a time. Some deal cards in a single batch, nine at a time.\nWhen playing with a kitty, some deal the four kitty cards singly at any points during the deal.\nAs in many other card games, some like to play with a rule that a player who has been dealt no aces or face cards (i.e. no card above a 10) can call a "misdeal".  The cards are thrown in, shuffled and cut again and the same dealer deals again.\nLe Rough\nThis variant from Quebec is played with a kitty but using only 36 cards: each player is dealt eight cards (4 at a time) and there is a four card kitty (mise), dealt in two cards at a time or all at once at any time during the deal. The minimum bid is 70 and the dealer is allowed to keep (garder) the bid. The bidder takes the kitty and may discard any four cards, which count for the bidder\'s team. The bidder\'s first lead determines the trump suit unless the bidder announces "sans atout" in which case the hand is played without trumps.\nThe target score is 350 points. If the bidder\'s team does not have a negative score, the bidder may, before taking the kitty, announce that the bidder\'s team will win all 100 card points. In this case, if they succeed they win the whole game, but if they lose the other team wins.\nSome play that if the first three players pass, the dealer must also pass. This puts pressure in the dealer\'s partner to bid at least 70, so that the dealer will not be forced to pass with a good hand.\nSix-player game\nSix players can play as two teams of three, sitting alternately, or as three teams of two, with partners facing each other. Using the normal 36-card pack each player is dealt 6 cards; if playing with a kitty 40 cards are used. Alternatively, a 6-player game with kitty can be played with the full 52-card pack, dealing 8 cards to each player. The "misdeal" rule is not be used with six players, since cards without aces or face cards are more frequent.\nThe bidding, play and scoring work the same way as in the four-player game.\nIn the game between three pairs, if a team loses by reaching the lower threshhold (minus 200 points in the 200-point game) while at least one other team has a zero or positive score, the losing team drops out while the other two teams keep their scores and continue playing a four-player game to determine the winners.\n200 with a Pot\nThis variation of the six-player game is played between three teams of two, using 40 cards, with 6 cards dealt to each player and a kitty of 4 cards.\n\nAt the start of the game, everyone pays the agreed ante (say one dollar) into a pot. \nIf the contracting team does not succeed their bid, each member of that team puts 50 cents (or whatever is decided) into the pot.  \nIf a bid suceeds, nobody pays, with one exception: if a team takes all 100 points in tricks (even if the bid is lower than 100), then everyone else puts in the cost of a lost bid (50 cents or whatever was decided).\nIf a hand is thrown in, all players passing, then each member of the dealer\'s team pays the cost of a lost bid (50 cents or whatever was decided).\n\nThe team that wins the game (500 points) divides the pot between them.\nFive-player Game\nI have been told that a five-player game exists using 40 cards (down to the 5). Each player is dealt 8 cards and there is no kitty. One player is a "silent partner" and plays as the partner of the winner of the bidding, the other four players bidding against each other.\nI do not know how the silent partner is chosen. The description I have says that this player has no team or score, and does not shuffle, deal or bid, which would suggest that the same player is dummy for the whole game. It would be fairer to rotate the partner with the deal - for example the player to dealer\'s right could be the silent partner (dummy).\nFor a more interesting five-player game I would suggest the following format. All players take part in the bidding, and the winning bidder calls a card whose holder will be the contractor\'s partner for that hand only. The partner does not announce who he or she is - this will become clear when the called card appears in the course of play. Each player\'s score is kept individually, the holder of the called card scoring the same as the contractor, and the other three players all scoring the points taken by their temporary team. This five-player format is successfully used in several other games, but I have not yet heard of it being used for 200.\nCutthroat 200\nIt is possible to play 200 without partners. The contractor plays alone against all the other players. Presumably each individual player scores the points taken in tricks, except that a contractor with insufficient points loses the amount of the bid. If playing this without a kitty, the minimum bid should perhaps be lowered.\nTwo Players\nUsing a 36-card pack, each player has a 9-card hand, and a "silent partner" whose cards are dealt in three stacks of three: two cards face down with a face-up card on top. \nThe game proceeds like the four-player game. The silent partners cannot bid, and when it is a silent partner\'s turn to play, the live partner plays one of the silent partner\'s face-up cards and turns the next card of the stack face up when the trick is complete. Like the live players, the silent partners must follow suit if possible, taking account only of the visible cards.\nTactics\nBidding\nA good hand for bidding is one with aces or other high cards, preferably in sequence, and with an unbalanced distribution including one or two long suits. Point cards other than aces are a liability.\nWhen the non-dealer\'s team is within 100 of the target, the first player will normally start with a low bid even with weak cards to make sure they can score their tricks if the dealer\'s team wins the bidding. Since a bid of 50 might be made purely for this tactical reason, the first player will probably start with at least 55 if holding genuine values, to let partner know that the bid was based on some strength.\nIf the dealer\'s team is within 100 of the target, the first player will often open with a high bid, to try to shut out the dealer\'s team or tempt them to bid too high.\nKitty\nWhen playing with a kitty, the kitty may improve the contractor\'s hand, but may sometimes make it worse. Best are aces or other high cards, or cards of your long suit. Worst are point cards, especially in your short suits - these can ruin an otherwise good hand.\nWhen discarding, the contractor will try to throw cards in weak, short suits, if possible getting rid of one or two suits entirely, so that the opponents\' aces in those suits can be cut.\nPlay\nAs in any trick-taking game, players should try to keep track of the cards that have been played, especially trumps, high cards and point cards. The winning bidder usually makes the last few tricks (he usually ends up with a trump or two). Knowing the exact trump position can greatly simplify your play. If you\'re with this player and know how many trumps he has, you know how and when you can save your points. This is even more important if he\'s not in your team. If you know how many trumps your oppenent has, you\'ll know if and when you should gamble your point cards.\nThe person who won the bid likely has the most trump cards. Therefore, the contractor\'s team will usually start by trying to draw all the opponents\' trump cards by repeatedly leading trumps. There are a few exceptions. For example if your partner won the bid and you can trump a suit, you may want to keep back your trump cards rather than leading them and hope to cut (trumpo) an opponent\'s ace. Later in the hand the contractor\'s partner should try to win tricks that will enable the contractor to dispose safely of endangered point cards in non-trump suits.\nAs in any partnership game, you should help your partner. For example when partner is winning the trick, you can throw a count card that might otherwise have been lost, but usually not an ace, since it might win a trick later. If your partner won the bid and you know he can cut (trump) a given suit, by all means lead that suit. He will be able to get rid of his unwanted cards (or cut if there are points in the trick).\nIf your team didn\'t win the bid, play your non-trump aces as soon as possible. Many players are tempted to keep their aces instead of playing them on a trick with no other points. This is a big gamble that should only be taken under exceptionnal circumstances. The reverse is true if your team won the bid and all of your opponents\' trump cards have been played - now you can keep aces to capture other point cards. However, you should be careful, especially if your partner won the bid. Everyone will know you have that ace and your partner may not have another card of that suit to lead to it, in which case you risk that the suit will never be led again and you will have to throw your ace on an opponent\'s trick at the end.\nIf the opposing team won the contract, play suits that havn\'t been played yet. You want your partner to play his aces and minimise the risk of being cut. Also, if there are aces left in play and your partner is the only player who hasn\'t led to a trick, there\'s a good chance that he\'s got that ace. Therefore is a good idea to lead a point card of that suit, especially if you have several point cards - you\'re not going to save them all, so you might as well try it.\nIf your team won the bid, you usually want to stay clear of leading a suit that hasn\'t been played yet (unless you have the ace, of course). Instead, try to make it so that either you or your partner can cut suits that havn\'t been played (because the ace of that suit is probably in your opponent\'s hand). If you must lead a suit that hasn\'t been played yet, play a suit in which you have a protected 10. This way, your opponents can\'t score so many points in that trick.\nIf you only have K-5 (or even K-10) of a given suit, you should almost always lead the 5 (or 10). You were probably going to lose it anyway, and this way, you will probably win the second trick in that suit.\nOther 200 web pages\nOn Facebook, Amlie Aubut has published the rules of Le Dix in Acadian French.\nThe Ange Hereux site has rules in French for Le Rough.\nHere is a version of La Barouche described in English by Stella Johnson and Francis Fisher.\n\nThis page is mainly based on information contributed by: Tony Bleyer, Martin Bourgeois, Andre Caissie, Claude Foley, Ann Fulton, John Furlong, Paul Gareau, Serge Guilbert, Denis Landry, Clarence Lavertu, Chris Leblanc, Dax Oliver and Cleo Saulnier.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > King-Ten-Five group > Two Hundred\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2006, 2012, 2013, 2014.

Bieten means bidding or betting. Each player is dealt just three cards, and points are won for the best heart, best leaf, best pair or triple, best sequence, and winning the last trick. Players can bet on any of these points: if the other players concede, the bettor automatically wins the point; if they contest the point its value is increased.\nPlayers and cards\nIn principle any reasonable number of players can take part, but the game is probably best for 3 to 5 players.\nA 33 card German suited pack is used. In each of the four suits hearts (rot), leaves (grn), bells (schellen) and acorns (eichel) the cards rank from high to low: ace, king, over, under, 10, 9, 8, 7. The 33rd card is a six of bells with some extra suit symbols and the title WELI; in the game of Bieten this functions as a wild card.\nIn the Austrian Tyrol, Bieten is normally played with cards of the William Tell pattern - sometimes known as the Seasons pattern because the aces illustrate the four seasons, and known as doppeldeutsche Karten because they are double headed and German suited. In the South Tyrol, the Salzburger pattern is more commonly used - these packs are sometimes sold as einfachdeutsche Karten - single headed German cards.\nThe cut and deal\nDeal and play are clockwise. The turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nThe dealer shuffles the cards and offers them to be cut by the player to the dealer\'s right. This player lifts the top part of the pack and looks at its bottom card, which would become the bottom card of the pack after the cut is completed. The cutting player is allowed to steal this bottom card, and place it face down, to become the first card of the cutting player\'s hand. This exposes the next card, which the cutter may also steal, exposing the third card, which may also be stolen, completing the cutter\'s hand. Any cards taken by the cutter are not shown to the other players, and the cutter cannot take more than three cards in this way.\nHaving taken 0, 1, 2 or 3 cards in this way, the cutter places the top part of the pack face down on the table and the dealer completes the cut in the usual way by placing the bottom section of the pack face down on top of it.\nThe dealer now deals three cards to each player in two rounds - either a single card to each followed by two cards to each or two cards to each followed by a single card to each. If the cutter stole some cards, the dealer deals correspondingly fewer cards to this player, so that at the end of the deal everyone has three cards.\nThe undealt cards is turned over and placed face up on the table in a neat stack. Thus the bottom card, which the cutter has already seen and rejected, will be known to everyone, but none of the other undealt cards is visible. These undealt cards are not used in the play.\nThe figures\nThere are five opportunities to score, known as Figuren (figures). These are Rot (red - i.e. heart), Grn (green - i.e. leaf), Gleich (equal), Hanger (sequence) and Spiel (game). The scores for these figures can be affected by betting, but if no one bets they are worth one point each as follows:\n\nThe point for Red is won by the player who holds the highest card of the heart suit that is in play. If no hearts have been dealt no one gets the point.\nThe point for Green is won by the player who holds the highest card of the leaf suit that is in play. If no leaves have been dealt no one gets the point.\nA Gleich consists of two or three cards of equal rank - for example two kings or three nines. The point is won by the player who holds the highest ranking triple, or if no one has a triple, by the player who holds the highest ranking pair. If no one has a triple or a pair the Gleich point is not awarded. It can also happen that there is a tie for best Gleich - for example if one player has two kings, another player has the other two kings and no one has a better Gleich than this. In case of a tie, the Gleich point is not awarded.\nA Hanger consists of two or three consecutive cards of one suit, such as ace-king or under-10-9. The point is won by the player who holds the highest ranking three-card sequence, or if no one has a three-card sequence, by the player who holds the highest ranking two-card sequence. If no one has a sequence, or if there is a tie for best sequence, the Hanger point is not awarded.\nThe point for Game is won by the winner of the last of the three tricks. This point is always awarded.\n\nBefore the play, it will not be clear who has won any of the points, because the players hold their cards concealed from each other. During the play, the cards are exposed, and the points are awarded after the last trick, when all the cards are face up.\nThe play\nThe cards are played out in three tricks.  Players play their cards by placing them face up in front of themselves, where they remain until the end of the hand.\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads to the first trick. The other players in turn must play a card of the same suit if they can - otherwise they may play any card. The trick is won by the highest card played of the suit that was led, and the winner leads to the second trick, which is played in the same way. The winner of the second trick leads to the last. The winner of the last trick scores the Game point, unless the Game has been bet and conceded (see below).\nThe Weli\nThe Weli can be used to represent any card that the holder does not possess. At the moment when the Weli is played to a trick, the person playing it must say what card it represents - the rank and suit must be specified. Once specified it cannot be changed until the next deal.\nThe real version of the card that the Weli represents may be in the hand of another player. For the purpose of deciding who wins a trick, or any of the figures, the Weli ranks immediately below the real version of the card it represents. For example, if a player plays the Weli, calling it the ace of hearts, it beats the king of hearts, but is beaten by the real ace of hearts. In the same way, a pair of real kings would beat one real king paired with the Weli representing a second king.\nNote that the Weli cannot be specified in a way that causes the holder to have broken the rule about following suit. For example, suppose you hold the nine of leaves, the ace of bells and the Weli. A heart is led to the first trick and you throw away your nine. Later you might be tempted to call your Weli the ace of hearts, to win the Red and Gleich points, but you cannot do this. You did not follow suit to the heart lead, so your Weli cannot be a heart.\nThe betting\nEach of the figures is initially worth one point, but a player can try to increase the value of a figure by betting on it. For example, if you say "Ich biete das Gleich" (I bet on the Gleich), that is a proposal to raise the value of the Gleich to two points in that hand. This can happen at any time: often a player will bet just before playing to a trick. As soon as there is a bet, the play pauses temporarily, and starting to the left of the player who bet, and continuing clockwise, the other players in turn must say whether they accept the increase. If you want the figure to be contested for two points you say "ich halte" (I hold); if you are content to allow the bettor to win one point for the figure without a contest, you say "gut" (good).\nIf all the other players say "good", the bettor wins one point for the figure, even if some other player would have won it if the hands had been compared. However, as soon as any player holds, the value of the figure is increased to two points, and the remaining players do not get a chance to speak. In this case, if there is no further betting on that figure, the player who wins it will score two points for it. Note that this might be the bettor, the player who held, or some other player: it is even possible for a player who said "good" to a figure to win it thanks to some other player having held it.\nAn important rule is that in order to bet or hold a figure, you must have that figure in your cards. For example, you can only bet on the red or hold another player\'s bet on red if you have at least one heart in your hand (or have the Weli, which you choose to play as a heart). In the same way, to bet on or hold the Gleich, you must have at least two equal cards, and so on for the other figures. \nAfter the first card of the last trick is played, it is illegal to bet on or hold the Game unless you have a card of the same suit that was led to the trick.\nNote that if you use the Weli as your justification for betting or holding, you must then use the Weli as a card which makes that bet or hold legal. Suppose you have the Weli and the King and Ober of bells. You can bet on Green, intending to make your Weli into a high leaf, but even if everyone says good, you cannot later bet on Red, because your Weli cannot be both a heart and a leaf. You could also bet on Gleich, but then your Weli would have to be the King or Ober of leaves. If the opponent who held your bet on the Green turns out to have the King of leaves, you cannot beat this by making your Weli the Ace of leaves if you have also bet on the Gleich.\nAt any time after a bet on a figure has been held, any player except the player who originally bet on that figure try to raise the score for it from two to three points, saying for example "Drei fr die Roten" (three for the red) or "Ich gebe einen Groschen" (I give a Groschen - which is a small coin originally worth three Kreuzer). Again, the other players in turn, starting to the left of the player who bet three, say "gut" (good) if they are prepared to allow the player who bet three to have two points for the figure without a contest, but if anyone insists on accepting the raise to three by saying "ich halte" (I hold), the later players need not say anything, because the player who wins the figure will now get three points.\nIt is not possible to raise the bet on any figure beyond three points.\nThe scoring\nAt the end of the play, the score for each player is calculated and added to their previous cumulative total. The basic scores for the five figures have already been explained:\n\nFor winning a figure on which there was no bet - 1 point\nFor betting a figure which everyone calls good - 1 point\nFor winning a figure which was bet and hold, but to which no one said three - 2 points\nFor saying three to a figure which was bet and held, if everone says good to the three - 2 points\nFor winning a figure on which a raise to three was held - 3 points.\n\nA player who held the Weli but fails to score for any of the five figures loses one point.\nEveryone\'s score starts from zero, and the game ends when any player\'s score reaches or exceeds an agreed target score - for example 11 points. Whoever has the lowest score at this point is the loser. A small cross is marked in the winner\'s column of the score sheet, while the loser gets a black spot called a Noggele or Bummerl.\nIn order to determine who has won and who has lost, the figures in the last deal are counted in a particular order. First the figures that have been bet are scored in the order in which they were first bet, and then the figures that were not bet are scored in the order: Red, Green, Gleich, Hanger, Game.\nA player who needs only one more point to reach the target is said to be "gespannt", and is no longer allowed to initiate a bet on a figure or to say three to a figure. If a player is gespannt at the start of a deal, this may be marked by drawing a line through the player\'s score on the score sheet - the player is "gestrichen". In the same way, if you only need two points to reach the target you are not allowed to say three to a figure. However, being gespannt does not prevent you from holding a bet by another player.\nIt is possible to become gespannt in the middle of a hand. For example, suppose you are playing to 11 points and have 9 already. You bet on the red and everyone says "good". So you have will have a point for this, and you are now barred from betting on any other figure, since that would certainly take your score over 11.\nThe penalty for most irregularities is that the offender loses two points. For exmaple you lose two points if:\n\nyou play a card of a different suit from the card led to a trick, when you could have followed suit;\nyou bet on or held a figure but it turns out that you do not have that figure in your hand (for example you bet on the green but you have no leaves at all);\nyou bet when you were gespannt - i.e. when your the score for your bet, if accepted and won, would have taken your score above the target.\n\n\n\nVariations\nA higher target score, such as 15, can be agreed for a longer game.\nSome play that after the winner has been determined, that player drops out of the game but the others continue playing further deals. Players drop out as they reach the target score, and the last player left in is the loser.\nSome levy higher penalties for irregularities, such as failing to follow suit. In some schools this entails losing your entire score so far or losing the whole game outright.\nApparently, some play that the Weli is not a wild card. Instead, the player who holds it is automatically awarded an extra point. This seems much less interesting than the normal game described above.\nConversely, some play with additional wild cards - not only the Weli but also the sevens of bells and acorns are wild. All of these wild cards rank below the real cards they represent, and among different wild cards representing the same card, the Weli beats the seven of bells, which beats the seven of acorns.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Last Trick group > Bieten\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001.

In the nineteenth century the game of Dom Pedro became popular in both Ireland and America. In Ireland the name was shortened to Don, and it seems likely that it was from Ireland that it spread to England and Wales.\nThe first version described on this page is Nine-card Don, which is played in Cheshire, Lancashire and South Wales. According to Arthur Taylor\'s "Guiness Book of Traditional Pub Games" (1992) it is also known as Big Don, Long Don, or Welsh Don.\nThe second game is Blind Don, or Two Player Don, which is a version of Nine-Card Don for two players, played in Lancashire.\nThe third version is played mainly in Ireland, and I have therefore called it Irish Don on this page, though in Ireland it is just known as Don. It differs from Nine-card Don in that all the cards are dealt - 13 to each player rather than nine, that the scoring value of the nines is increased, and that there is no score for \'game\'.\nThe fourth game on this page is Phat, which is played in England and Scotland, and is quite similar to Irish Don, but with the \'game\' score as in 9-card Don included. I do not know the origin of the name Phat, which is applied to the high scoring cards as well as the game overall. It is tempting to think that the valuable cards are \'fat\' because they carry many points, but that does not account for the spelling of the name.\nNine Card Don\n\nThis description is based on information from players in the Bolton Don League (Lancashire) and the Abercarn Crib and Don League (South Wales), and reports from other players in both areas: Pontypool, Bridgend and Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales and Preston in Lancashire.\n\nI am told that this game is also extremely popular in Cheshire and former parts of \nCheshire such as Widnes, Stockport and Stalybridge. It is played intensively in the Cheshire Regiment -  now 1st Bn The \n  Mercian Regiment (Cheshire) and  also, to a lesser extent, in the Staffordshire Regiment - now 3rd Bn The Mercian Regiment \n(Staffordshire).\nPlayers and objective\nThere are four players in fixed partnerships; partners sit opposite each other. Deal and play are clockwise. This is a point trick game: each team scores points during the play for winning particular cards in tricks, and also the team which has the greater total value of cards in their tricks, according to a different card value scale, scores extra points. The first team to reach an agreed total (91 or 121) wins the game.\nCards, Ranking and Values\nA standard 52 card pack is used. The cards in each of the four suits rank from high to low A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nTricks have no value in themselves; the object is to win tricks with certain cards in them. It is important to distinguish between the points that are scored during the play (usually by pegging on a peg board) for winning tricks containing particular trumps or any five, and the card values in all suits that are used to decide which team scores the extra points for \'game\' at the end of the play.\n\n\nPoints scored immediatelyfor cards and game\nAce of trumps4 points\nKing of trumps3 points\nQueen of trumps2 points\nJack of trumps1 point\n9 of trumps9 points\n5 of trumps10 points\nEach non-trump 55 points\nGame8 points\n\nCard values used to decide which teamscores the 8 points for game\n\nEach Ace4 points\nEach King3 points\nEach Queen2 points\nEach Jack1 point\nEach Ten10 points\n\nIf both teams have cards withthe same total value then neither teamscores the points for game\n\nIn South Wales the Fives are generally known as Dons.\nChoice of players, Seating, Deal\nThe cards are cut for first \'pitch\', i.e. the right to lead first (and make trumps) on the first deal. One player from each partnership draws a card and the higher card wins, with Ace counting high. The winner of the cut decides who will lead to the first trick (normally if you win the cut you should give the first pitch to yourself or your partner).\nThe person to the right of the player with the pitch is the first dealer. The dealer shuffles, and offers the cards to the player on his right to cut. The dealer then deals nine cards to each player, one at a time. The remaining 16 cards are set aside face down and are not used in that hand. Subsequently the turn to deal rotates clockwise after each hand. The pitcher is the player to dealer\'s left.\nThe players may look at and sort their hands, except for the player to dealer\'s right - the pitcher\'s partner - who must not touch the cards until after the first card has been led. (This is to prevent any possibility of illegally signalling to the pitcher which suit to make trumps.)\nIn Lancashire, Don is often played in pubs, where there may be more than four people waiting for a game. In this case, a procedure called \'jacks out\' is used to decide which four people will play. Those who wish to take part (5 to 7 people - because if there were 8 you would have two complete tables) each place a stake (typically a pound - maybe 5 pounds) on the table, and the cards are dealt out one at a time, face up to the stakes. When a jack appears, the player who contributed that stake is in the game, and no further cards are dealt to that stake. Where the four jacks eventually land, those are the players. All the stakes, including those of the players who were not selected, form a pool which goes to the eventual winners of the game. Partnerships are then determined by cutting cards. In some pubs, people also bet on who will be partners.\nPlay\nThe player to dealer\'s left is the pitcher. The pitcher leads to the first trick, and the suit of the first card led becomes trumps for the remainder of the hand. The pitcher\'s partner may then pick up his or her cards. Tricks are won by the highest card of the suit led unless trumped, in which case the highest trump wins. Players must follow suit (play a card of the same suit as the card that was led) whenever possible; a player who has no card of the suit led may trump or discard at will. The winner of each trick leads to the next trick.\nScoring\nScores are often kept by pegging on a Cribbage board:\n\nWhen any of the scoring trumps (A, K, Q, J, 9, 5) or any other five is played, the team that wins the trick pegs the points shown in the left hand table above at the end of the trick.\nWhen all nine tricks have been played, each team counts the total value of the cards they have taken, according to the right hand table above, and the team that has more pegs 8 points for game. In case of a tie, neither team gets these 8 points.\nIt can be seen that the maximum number of points that it is possible to peg on the board from one hand, by winning all the scoring cards and the game is 52:\n\n4+3+2+1 = 10 for A K Q J of trumps\n10+9 = 19 for 9 and 5 of trumps\n5+5+5 = 15 for the other 5\'s\nand also 8 for game\n\nOften, fewer than 52 points are available, because some of the scoring cards are among the 16 undealt cards.\nIn Lancashire the winners are the first team to reach 91 points or more (one and a half times round the board).\nIn South Wales the first team to reach or pass 121 points (twice round the board) wins the \'leg\'. For the next leg, the partnerships remain the same, and there is a new cut for pitch, normally between the two players who did not cut at the start of the previous leg. The first team who win two legs are the overall winners of the match.\nIn Cheshire, each row of 30 holes is a "leg", so a complete game (121 points) contains four legs.\nVariations\n\n1 for high; 1 for jack; 6 for game\nKen Swain repports that in Preston, Lancashire, instead of pegging 8 points for game at the end of play, the team that has taken the greater total value in cards scores only 6 points. In addition, one point is pegged by the team that took the Jack of trumps in a trick (additional to the point scored at the end of the trick to which the Jack was played), and one point is pegged by the team that had the highest trump. If the jack was not dealt, then the jack point is not scored.\n1 for high, 1 for low, 1 for jack, 5 for game\nPhil Wrench of Macclesfield and Colin Rawlinson of Barrow in Furness report a version  in which points are scored at the end of the play for high, low, jack and game. The high point is pegged by the team that was dealt the highest trump, the low point by the team that took the trick containing the lowest trump, the jack point by the team that wins the jack (if it is dealt) and the 5 points for game are pegged by the team with most card points (in case of a tie no one gets the points). Note that these points are only pegged at the end of the play, and strictly in the order high, low, jack, game. This order of precedence can be important if both teams are close to winning.\nAnother feature of the Macclesfield game is that when the cards are cut at the start, it is the team that draws the lower card (ace counting as high) that pitches first.\nThe separate scoring of \'high\', \'low\', \'jack\' and \'game\' at the end of the play, as in its ancestor All Fours, presumably represents an older form of the game that was later simplified in many places by consolidating these scores into a single 8-point score for game.\nFour Pitches\nIn Burnley a game consists of \'four pitches\' - that is one deal by each player - at the end of which the team with the higher score wins. The \'1 for high, 1 for low, 1 for jack, 5 for game\' method of scoring is used.\nJacks Out\nIn the Cheshire Regiment the \n  formation of a Don School is heralded by the cry "Jacks Out".  People \n  then purchase a number of cards from the pack at a set price per card \n  and this becomes the kitty, to be collected by the winning team.  Each potential player is dealt the number of cards purchased, face up, and this is repeated until all the Jacks have appeared. A player who already has one or more Jacks is dealt that number fewer cards in subsequent rounds of dealing. For example a player who bought 5 cards and gets two jacks in his first 5 cards will be dealt only 3 further cards when the deal comes round to him again. The player who has the advantage of being dealt the first cards is determined by cutting a card and counting around from the (impartial) dealer (J=11, Q=12, K=13). If the four Jacks are dealt to four different people, these are the players,  paired off as red versus black.   A player who gets  two Jacks \n  may sell one on to someone who has none.  A player who is dealt three Jacks wins the kitty outright and if two players get two Jacks each they divide the kitty equally between them: the cry is "No game, Jacks out" and the purchasing of cards \n  starts again. Side bets are common, for example on the first team to reach a certain score, on who will win the 8 points for game on a particular deal, on how many tricks a team will win, and so on.\nCrib and Don League\nThe Abercarn Crib and Don League consists of 12 pub or club teams, with a minimum of five players in each team, though teams sometimes turn out with more than ten players. Nine matches are played, three of Don, three of Double Cribbage and three of Single Crib. Each of these nine matches is played as the best of three \'legs\', with the match winners scoring one point towards the team\'s total for the night.\nDouble Cribbage is four player cribbage with fixed partnerships; five cards each are dealt, one being discarded to dealer\'s box. Game is 121 points. Single Crib is two-player five card cribbage, played to 61 points.\nWhen all the matches have been played the number won by each team is added to their running total of championship points. For example, if a team wins 7 - 2 then they get 7 league championship points, whilst their opponents get 2.\nCard ranks and values\nA previous edition of this page stated that the ranking of cards in the trump suit in Lancashire from high to low was 5 9 A K Q J 10 8 7 6 4 3 2, but this was an error. Subsequent enquiries confirm that the ace of trumps is the highest card in all regions where this game is played. The misunderstanding arose because the trumps are often listed in order of their point scoring values, rather than in ranking order. Unfortunately my mistake has since been copied in various books. I apologise for my part in propagating this error.\nIn his Guinness Book of Traditional Pub Games, published in 1992 before this web page existed, Arthur Taylor listed the trumps in the order 9-5-A-K-Q-J without making it clear whether this was intended to be the ranking order. His book also gave the 5 of trumps a scoring value of 19 points rather than 10, but it seems likely that this was a misprint.\n\nIrregularities\nThe following penalties for irregulaties are those used by my informants in Bolton. \n\nPlaying out of turn\nFriendly: The card is \'boarded\', meaning the card is left face up on the table and it must be played at the next legal opportunity.\nLeague: In addition, the offending team loses 19 points from their score.\nReneging: Failing to play a card of the suit led, although you have such a card.\nFriendly: The deal is abandoned, and there is a re-deal.\nLeague: In addition, the offending team is penalised 52 points.\n\nBlind Don\nThis two player version of Nine Card Don was contributed by Bernard Scott, who learned it in a weaving mill in Burnley, Lancashire in the 1970\'s.\nIn each deal one player is dealer, the other player pitches. First pitch is decided by a cut, Ace high, winner pitches. Deal and pitch alternate.\n36 cards are dealt as follows. The first 18 cards are dealt face down, starting on the left, alternately to each player, so that each player has a row of nine cards. (This is possibly the reason for the name - Blind Don). Then 18 more cards are dealt, face up, one on top of each face down card, alternately to each player starting (again) on the left. Here is a visual example of a deal, provided by Bernard Scott.\nCard ranking and values are as Nine Card Don. Play is also as in Nine Card Don, each player playing from his own face up cards and each trick consisting of just two cards. After both players have played to a trick, any face down card that is exposed, the card on top of it having been played, is turned face up and is available for play.\nThe scoring is the same as in Nine Card Don, using the \'1 for high, 1 for low, 1 for jack and 5 for game\' version. Four pitches are played (two deals by each player), the winner being the player with the higher score.\nColin Rawlinson describes another version of Blind Don, from the Stalybridge / Hyde area near Manchester, \n  in which the two players get 7 cards each face down and then the pitcher gets 7 face-up on top of the first cards, while the dealer gets 7 face-down on top of the first cards. Then each player is dealt 4 cards face\n  as a hand, which they pick up and look at but is unseen by the other player.\n  The pitcher calls trumps on the basis of  the 4 cards in his hand and his 7\n  exposed cards, after which the dealer turns the  7 cards on top of his stacks face up  and the game commences.\n  Cards can be played from the table or the hand and in all other respects\n  the play is the same as in the version of Blind Don described above.\nColin Rawlinson also suggests a  3-player adaptation played as above, in which each player has 5 two-card stacks and 4 cards in  hand, leaving just 10 cards unused.\nIrish Don\nThis description is compiled from information from several players in Ireland, mainly in Dublin and Cork. I have also had reports of this game played in Britain by people of Irish descent.\n\nPlayers and Cards\nThere are four players in two fixed partenerships, partners facing each other across the table. A standard 52 card pack is used, the cards ranking from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2 in every suit.\nPoints are scored for the winners of tricks that contain certain cards as follows:\n\n\nAce of trumps4 points\nKing of trumps3 points\nQueen of trumps2 points\nJack of trumps1 point\n9 of trumps ("Big Don")18 points\n5 of trumps ("Little Don")10 points\nEach non-trump 99 points\nEach non-trump 55 points\n\nThere are thus 80 points to be scored in total in each deal.\nSome players play with a reduced pack of 48 or 44 cards, obtained by removing the twos and sometimes also the threes from a standard pack. The players will then have only 12 or 11 cards each; the scoring is not affected since none of the removed cards are scoring cards.\nDeal and play\nDeal and play are clockwise. Anyone can deal first. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts, and the dealer deals out all the cards, one at a time, so that everyone has 13 cards. In the first hand, the holder of the 2 "pitches" or "pucks out" (leads to the first trick). (Some groups use the 2 to determine the first pitcher.) For the next deal, the turn to pitch passes to the left, and the dealer is the pitcher in the previous hand (so the pitcher is the player to the left of the dealer). \nThe suit of the card led by the pitcher to the first trick becomes trumps for that deal. As in Nine Card Don, the pitcher\'s partner should not look at his or her cards until after this first card has been led.\nPlayers must follow suit when possible. A player unable to follow suit may play any card. A trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if no trumps are played, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nAs in most partnership card games, it is illegal to talk or give signs to your partner as to what cards you hold or what you would like partner to play. Inappropriate covert communication with your team mate is called \'billying\'.\nScoring\nRather than pegging scores during play, each team waits to the end of the play and counts the scoring cards they have in their tricks. Since all the cards are in play, the two teams\' scores must always add up to 80. Winning all 80 points in a deal is sometimes called doing the bonk.\nThe first team that scores more than 80 points wins the game. Therefore a game lasts just two deals (one pitch by each team), unless one team is so far behind at the end of the first deal that they decide to concede the game.\nIt is normal for the players just to remember the score from the first deal - no paper or peg board is used to record it. During the second deal a team that has 80 points can stop the play and claim to have won. If the second deal is played to the end and the scores are 80-80, then the last team that took a scoring trick are the losers, since the other team must have reached 80 before them.\nVariations\nSome groups play the best of three games: after the first game, the turns to deal and pitch again pass to the left so that everyone pitches once. If after four deals the teams have won one game each, the 2 or 3 is used again to determine the first pitcher for the deciding game of two deals.\nSome groups play that the overall winners are the first to win an agreed number of games.\nSome play that if the score at the end of the second deal is 80-80 the game is a draw - no one wins or loses.\nPhat\nCompiled from information from Cheshire, Rugely in Staffordshire, Motherwell and Wishaw in Scotland; Arthur Taylor reports in his book that it is also played around Norwich.\nPlayers, Cards and Objective\nThere are four players, partners sitting opposite each other. A standard 52 card pack is used.\nThe aim is to score points by winning tricks containing valuable cards. Some cards - the phat - give an immediate score to the team that wins the trick to which they are played. These are recorded on a peg board - see below. Further points are pegged after the end of the play by the team that has collected more than half of the muck in their tricks.\n\n\nThe Phat\nAce of trumps4 points\nKing of trumps3 points\nQueen of trumps2 points\nJack of trumps1 point\n9 of trumps18 points\n5 of trumps10 points\nEach non-trump 99 points\nEach non-trump 55 points\n\nMajority of muck8 points\n\nThe Muck\n\nEach Ace4 points\nEach King3 points\nEach Queen2 points\nEach Jack1 point\nEach Ten10 points\n\nThe total is 80 points.A team that collects in their tricksat least 41 points of muckpegs 8 points on the board\n\nIn Scotland, the trump nine is called the "Big Don" and the trump five is the "Wee Don", though in the English Midlands these terms are not known.\nDeal and Play\nDeal and play are clockwise. Each player cuts a card, and whoever cuts the lowest card will pitch first. The delaer will be the player to the right of the pitcher. The turn to deal passes to the left after each hand, and the pitcher is the player to dealer\'s left.\nThe dealer deals out all the cards one at a time, so that each player has 13 cards. The player to dealer\'s right (the picher\'s partner) must not pick up his or her cards until the pitcher has led.\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads first, and the suit of the card led to the first trick is trumps for remainder of the hand. Players must follow suit if they can; a player with no card of the suit led can trump or throw away at will. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if none are played, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick.\nScoring\nThe score is usually kept on a peg board which is like a cribbage board but half as long again:\n\nIn Scotland, I am told that the scores are written down on a special score sheet.\nPoints are scored or pegged at the end of each trick containing phat, and at the end of the play for muck, as described above. The first team to peg a total of 181 points (twice round the board) wins the game.\nSince there are 88 points in each deal - 80 phat plus 8 for the muck - most games are completed within four deals - one pitch by each player. If neither team has won by then a fifth deal is started, and the winners are the first team to peg enough phat to reach 181. The pitcher for the fifth deal will of course be the same as for the first deal. Note that muck cannot count in this fifth deal, since the phat will always be sufficient to allow one team to reach 181 before the end of play.\nIt sometimes happens that each team has 40 points of muck. In that case the 8 points are carried over to the next deal, and the team with more muck will then peg 16 - 8 for the new deal plus 8 carried over.\nSome play that if the muck is tied 40-40 but one team has the majority of tens (three or four), that team wins the 8 points for muck. If the tens are also divided 2-2 the muck has to be carried over as above.\nSoftware\nYou can download a freeware Don program from Thanos Card Games.\nContributors\nThanks to the following people who provided the information on which this page is based: Alan Byrne, Peter Conlon, Donncha Daly, Daniel Dunne, Pete Eccles, David Hodgson, Stephen Lowry, Les McDonald, Ian Morgan, Steve Povey, Colin Rawlinson, Simon Roberts, Tony Roberts, Bernard Scott, James Smith, Tony Street, Ken Swain, Eddie Watkins, Jim Wilkin, Richie Wormald, Phil Wrench.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > All Fours Group > Don, Phat\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1996, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2011.

It seems that it was  first introduced in the 1980\'s, but it quickly achieved great popularity among casino and tournament players. In Omaha, each player receives four private cards and there are five community cards on the table. In the showdown exactly two private cards together with three community cards must be used to make the player\'s best hand.\nThis page assumes some familiarity with the general rules and terminology of poker. See the poker rules page for an introduction to these, and the poker betting and poker hand ranking pages for further details.\nOmaha High\nPlayers and Cards\nFrom two to ten players can take part. A standard international 52-card pack is used.\nThe Deal and Betting\nOmaha is usually played with no ante, but with blinds. When there are more than two players, the player to dealer\'s left places a small blind, and the next player to the left a big blind. The big blind is equal to the minimum bet and the small blind is typically half that amount. When there are only two players (a "heads-up" game), the dealer places the small blind and the non-dealer the big blind. Omaha High is often played with a pot limit betting structure, though other limits are possible - see betting limits for details.\nThe cards are shuffled and cut, the dealer "burns" one card and then deals the cards one at a time face down until each player has four cards. These are known as the player\'s hole cards or pocket cards. Players may look at their four hole cards and must not show them to any other player.\nThe first betting round is begun by the player to the left of the big blind. The blinds count as bets, so the small blind need only pay the difference between the blinds to call. The big blind player acts last and is allowed to raise, even if the other active players have all called.\nAfter the first betting round the dealer burns one card and deals three cards face up to the table. These three cards are known as the flop. There is then a second betting round begun by the first active player to the left of the dealer seat.\nWhen the second betting round is complete, the dealer burns a card and then deals one card face up to the table. This card is known as the turn or fourth street. There is then a third betting round, again begun by the first active player to the left of the dealer seat.\nAfter the third betting round the dealer burns another card and deals one more card face up - the river or fifth street. There is fourth and final round of betting before the showdown, again begun by the first active player to the left of the dealer seat.\nThe Showdown\nActive players show all four of their cards in clockwise order, beginning with the who was the last to bet or raise in the final betting round. If everyone checked in the final betting round, the first active player to the left of the dealer seat is the first to show. See the betting and showdown page for further details.\nEach player makes the highest possible five-card poker hand using exactly two of their own cards with exactly three of the face-up table cards, which are known as the board. \nNote that:\n\nFor a hand to be considered for winning the pot, the player must show all four hole cards, even though only two of them are used to make the best hand.\nThe cards speak for themselves: the best hand is entitled to win the pot if shown, even if the owner does not realise that it is the best hand.\nAs always, poker hands consist of just five cards. The two unused hole cards and two unused board cards have no bearing on whether one hand is better than another.\n\nVariations\nThe Swedish variant Sviten Special is described on a separate page.\nOmaha High-Low 8 or Better\nOmaha is very often played in such a way that the pot is split between the players with the highest and lowest hands. Since a low hand has to have no card higher than 8 to win its share of the pot, the game is called Omaha High-Low Eight or Better or Omaha/8 for short. This is commonly played as a fixed limit game. The deal is the same as in Omaha High, described above, but with fixed limits the size of the bet doubles after the turn card is dealt, so that the third and fourth betting rounds are played with big bets. \nAt the showdown, each active player makes  their highest hand and their lowest  hand. Each of these hands must use exactly two hole cards (but not necessarily the same two cards for high and for low) and exactly three board cards (but not necessarily the same three). When making a low hand, the five cards must all be of different ranks, the aces count as low, straights and flushes do not count, and no card can be higher than an 8. So  the best low hand is A-2-3-4-5 and the worst is 8-7-6-5-4. Cards are compared from the top down, so 7-5-4-3-2 is better than 7-6-3-2-A because the 5 is lower than the 6. \nIn this game the cards speak for themselves. This is important because some hands can be quite confusing to read. In a formal game the non-playing dealer will read the hands and tell the players what they have, but in any case it is the duty of all players to try to ensure that the the highest and lowest hands are correctly identified, and to speak up if any hand is wrongly evaluated.\nExample: player:  \nboard: \nThis player has a club flush A-8-6-4-2 for high (not a full house, which would use three hole cards). The low hand is 6-4-3-2-A using the 2 and either a 6 or the 4 from the the player\'s hand.\nThe pot is split equally between the highest hand and the lowest hand. If players tie for highest or for lowest, that half of the pot is divided equally between them. If none of the active players qualifies for low (which will automatically be the case if there are not three different cards lower than 9 on the board), then the player with the highest hand wins the whole pot.\nVariant\nA five-card variant of Omaha/8 is sometimes played. This is exactly like the four-card Omaha/8 described above, except that each player is dealt five private cards. As in four-card Omaha/8 hands are formed of exactly two private cards with exactly three board cards.\nOther sites\nO8 Poker is dedicated to  Omaha Hi/Lo 8 or better, giving rules and advice, offering a personal coaching service, and providing brief reviews of some sites where it can be played online.\nFive Card Omaha\nThis is exactly like normal Omaha except that each player is dealt five private cards. As in four-card Omaha, hands are formed of exactly two private cards with exactly three board cards. There are five-card versions of Omaha High and of Omaha/8. These games, and the six-card game below, are sometimes known as Big O.\nSix Card Omaha\nThis is the same as normal Omaha except that each player is dealt six private cards. As usual, hands must use exactly two private cards and three board cards.\nCourchevel\nThis variant is popular in France and has spread to other parts of Europe, including the UK. Five hole cards are dealt to each player and in addition, one card is dealt face up to the table before the first betting round. After the first betting round a card is burned and two more are dealt face up to the table to complete the three-card flop, and there is a second betting round. Then as in normal Omaha a fourth table card (the turn) is dealt face up followed by a third betting round, and  a fifth table card (the river) is dealt, followed by a final betting round. In the showdown, players must use exactly two of their five hole cards together with exactly three of the five table cards to make their hand, and the best hand wins the pot.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Omaha\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2010, 2014.

It uses a 52-card pack without jokers and takes its name from the fact that the threes are the highest cards. It is also known as Dig a Hole (Wa Keng -  - the idea being that the bidder digs up the four undealt cards in the hope of finding buried treasure. There are usually three players, and in each hand one player plays against the other two, trying to be the first to play out all his cards in valid combinations.\nPlayers, Cards and Deal\nBig Three is normally played by three people, each ultimately playing for themselves, though in each hand two players will be allied against the third. Play is counter-clockwise.\nThe cards rank from high to low: 3, 2, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. The suits have no significance.\nAt the start of a session of play the cards are shuffled and each player player draws one card from the face down pack and shows it. Whoever drew the highest number card (aces counting as 1 and pictures as zero) will be the "dealer" for the first hand, but as in most Chinese games the cards are not really dealt, but taken from the deck by the players.\nThe "dealer" shuffles the cards, gives them to the player to his left to cut, and stacks them face down in the middle of the playing surface. The dealer then draws the top card from the deck, looking at it but not showing it to the other players. The player to his right does the same, then the third player, then the dealer and so on counter-clockwise around the table until each player has 16 cards. The last four cards are left face down on the table until after the auction. It saves time if you look at your cards and sort them as you pick them up.\nSubsequently the winner of each hand (the player who first ran out of cards) "deals" the next hand, shuffling and taking the first card.\nAuction\nAfter the deal, there is then an auction to determine which player will play alone against the other two. The possible bids are 1, 2 and 3.  The bidding is begun by the player holding the four of hearts, or the player holding lowest heart if the four of hearts is among the cards face down in the middle.  This first player must bid at least 1.  The bidding continues counter-clockwise, each player passing or bidding higher than the previous bidder, until two consecutive players pass or someone bids 3, which ends the auction since it is the highest possible bid.  The final and highest bidder now picks up the four face-down cards from the middle, for a total of 20 cards.  Although the bidder has a larger hand than the opponents, these extra cards may enable more combinations to be formed, which can helps the bidder to get rid of cards faster than the other players.\nPlay\nIrrespective of who won the bidding, the player who spoke first in the auction (having had the lowest heart at that time) also plays first.  The possible plays are:\n\nany single card, \nany pair of equal cards, \nany triplet (three equal cards), \nany quad (all four cards of a rank), \na run of three or more consecutive cards (such as 9-10-J or 5-6-7-8-9), \na run of three or more consecutive pairs (such as 6-6-7-7-8-8-9-9), \na run of three or more consecutive triplets, \na run of three or more consecutive quads.\n\nAces, twos and threes cannot be used in runs (neither in single runs nor in runs of pairs, triplets or quads).\nAfter the first player has played, each subsequent player in anticlockwise order must either pass (play no card) or beat the previous play by playing a higher combination of the same number of cards and same type.  For example if the previous play was 6-7-8-9 you can play 7-8-9-10 or 10-J-Q-K to beat it.  You cannot play 8-9-10-J-Q (too many cards), nor 6-7-8-9 (not high enough), nor J-J-J-J (wrong type of combination).  This continues around the table for as many circuits as necessary. It is possible to play after passing, but if two consecutive players pass, the played cards are turned face down and put aside, and the person who played highest starts again by playing a new combination of any type.\nExample:  For example, player A (the bidder) leads a pair: 5-5, player B to his right, having no small pair, passes, and the other opponent (C) plays 9-9. The bidder beats this with K-K and now B beats this with 2-2.  (B could have played the 2-2 directly on the 5-5, but this would have deprived his partner C of the chance to get rid of a small pair (9-9).)  C and A both pass, so the played cards are set aside and it is B\'s turn. B plays a run 5-6-7 and C beats it with a high run J-Q-K. Since aces, twos and threes cannot be used in runs, this run is unbeatable, and A and B have to pass. Again the played cards are set aside and C can now play any legal card combination. For example C might now lead a single 4, to get rid of it.\nThe play continues until someone runs out of cards.\nScoring\nIf the bidder runs out of cards first he has won, and each opponent pays him the amount of the bid: 1, 2 or 3 units.  If one of the other two players runs out first, the bidder has lost and must pay the amount of the bid to each opponent.\nNote that since the opponents of the bidder stand to win or lose equally, they form a temporary partnership. When playing against the bidder it is just as profitable to help your partner to run out of cards first as to win yourself.  Because of this the partners will usually not beat each others cards, and the weaker partner will play to help the stronger partner. \nFour-player Game\nThere is a four-player version of Big Three. Each player takes 13 cards and there is no kitty.  The highest bidder calls any specific card from 4 to 10 that is not in their hand - for example 8 of clubs - and the holder of that card becomes their partner, but this is not revealed until the card is played.\nThe play is the same as in the three-player game, except that now three consecutive passes are needed in order for the cards top be set aside and the player of the last and highest card combination to be able to restart with a new type of combination.\nWhen someone runs out of cards, that player\'s team wins. Each member of the losing team pays the bid amount, and each member of the winning team receives the bid amount.\nSoftware\nThe Chinese version of the shareware game Happy DigPit for Windows is available, though the  English language version has unfortunately disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Climbing games > Big Three\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2007.

It has several alternative names:\n\nBig Two, Big Deuce or Deuces are the names commonly used in the English speaking world (mainly USA and Australia).\nDa Lao Er () is Mandarin Chinese and literally means "big old two", but also has a vulgar meaning, in that Lao Er (old two) is slang for penis. \nChoh Dai Di or simply Dai Di - written  \nor more often as D\n, surprisingly using a Western letter D for the last syllable. I am not certain from what Chinese dialect this term originates. In Cantonese, "di2" is a slang term for the two in card games: the first way of writing it seems to have a literal meaning connected with the earth, but in fact, like "D", it is just a phonetic approximation to the sound. There is general agreement that the whole phrase refers to the fact that in this game the two is the highest rather than the lowest card, and that "Big Two" is an accurate translation of the sense. One correspondent told me it is Hokkien (Fujian) meaning \'play the biggest smallest\'; another says it is not Hokkien, but that \'Dai D\' is Hong Kong (Cantonese) slang for \'the little guy\', and the whole name means \'step on the little guy\'.\nBu Bu Gao Sheng () ("step by step rise higher") is another name used for this game in Taiwan.\nPusoy Dos is the usual name used in the Philippines, with the stress on the second syllable of Pusoy. Ruben Canlas Jr. tells me that this translates into English as "Poker Two" - "Pusoy" being the Filipino name for Poker. \nMathijs Claasen reports that in the Netherlands it is called Sjalalin.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many variations of this game. First I will describe the basic game as played in China.\nPlayers and Cards\nThe game is for best for four players, each playing for themselves. (It is possible to play with three or two - the necessary adaptations are given later.)\nA standard 52 card pack is used, the cards ranking from high to low: 2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3. There is also an ordering of suits - from high to low: spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds (but see variations). \nObject of the Game\nThe object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all of your cards, by playing them to the table. Cards can be played singly or in certain combinations. If you cannot be first to play all your cards, then your aim is to have as few cards as possible when another player finishes.\nPlayable Combinations\nThere are four types of legal play: single cards, pairs, triples and five card groups.\n\nSingle cards\nThese rank from two (high) down to three (low), and between cards of the same rank a higher suit beats a lower suit.Pairs\nA pair of equal ranked cards - twos are highest and threes are lowest. Any higher ranked pair beats one with lower ranks. Between equal ranked pairs, the one containing the highest suit is better - for example 9-9 beats 9-9 because the spade is higher than the heart, but Q-Q beats J-J because queens beat jacks.\nTriples\nThree equal ranked cards - three twos are highest, then aces, kings, etc. down to three threes, which is the lowest triple.\nFive card groups\nThere five types of playable five-card combination. In ascending order they are: straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush.\n\nA Straight consists of five cards of consecutive rank with mixed suits. A straight with higher ranks beats a lower one, irrespective of the suits of the cards. When the ranks are the same, the suit of the top card determines which is higher. So for example K-Q-J-10-9 beats Q-J-10-9-8, which beats Q-J-10-9-8. Twos do not rank high in straights, but below the 3, so the highest straight is A-K-Q-J-10 including the ace of spades. Aces can be counted as low to make the lowest type of straight 5-4-3-2-A, which is beaten by 6-5-4-3-2 and 7-6-5-4-3. An ace can be used at either end of a straight, but not in the middle, so collections like 3-2-A-K-Q or 2-A-K-Q-J are not valid straights (but there are variations on this rule).\nA Flush consists of any five cards of the same suit. A flush in a higher suit beats a flush in a lower suit, irrespective of the ranks of the cards. Between two flushes in the same suit, the one with the higher top card is better. So for example 9-7-6-5-3 beats 2-J-9-6-4, which beats A-K-Q-10-7.\nA Full House consists of three cards of one rank and two of another rank; between two full houses, the one whose triple is of higher rank is better - so for example 9-9-9-4-4 beats 8-8-8-K-K.\nFour of a kind (or quads) are made up of all four cards of one rank, plus any fifth card. The fifth card must be included - four equal cards by themselves are not a playable combination. Between two fours of a kind, the rank of the four cards determines which is higher.\nA Straight Flush consists of five consecutive cards of the same suit, twos ranking below threes and aces ranking high or low, as in straights. The rank of the highest card determines which of two straight flushes is higher; between two equal ranked straight flushes, the one in the higher suit is better, so the Royal Flush in spades A-K-Q-J-10 is the highest straight flush and the best five-card combination, but there are variations on this rule. \n\nA combination can only be beaten by a better combination with the same number of cards: so a single card can only be beaten by a single card, a pair by a better pair and a triple by a better triple. You cannot for example use a triple to beat a pair or a straight to beat a triple. However, a five card group can be beaten by a five card group of a stronger type - any flush beats any straight, any full house beats any straight or flush, any four of a kind plus an odd card beats any straight, flush or full house and any straight flush beats all of the other type of five card group.\nNote that although the playable combinations are similar to poker hands, there are important differences. For example, there is no "two pair" combination, and although a four of a kind requires a fifth card to complete the combination, a triple cannot be accompanied by extra cards (unless of course these make it into quads or a full house).\nThe Deal\nDeal and play are normally anticlockwise. Any player may deal first; thereafter the winner of each hand deals the next. The dealer shuffles and the player to dealer\'s right cuts.\nHaving completed the cut, the dealer exposes a card to determine who will be dealt the first card. This is done by lifting the top part of the pack, showing the bottom card of the lifted part, and replacing the lifted section on top of the pack, so that this second "cut" does not disturb the order of the cards in the pack and the exposed card remains in the middle. To determine who gets the first card, count the players starting with the dealer and continuing in the direction of play until the rank of the exposed card is reached. So if it was an ace, 5, 9 or king the dealer will get the first card, if it was a 2, 6 or 10 the player to dealer\'s right, if it was a 3, 7 or jack the player opposite the dealer and is it was a 4, 8 or queen, the player to dealer\'s left.\nThe dealer deals out the cards, one at a time, starting with the player designated by the above process and continuing anticlockwise until all the cards are dealt. So everyone will have a hand of 13 cards, which they can look at and sort.\nThe Play\nThe player who holds the three of diamonds begins and must play this card, either by itself or as part of a legal combination. The person to this player\'s right plays next, and so on round the table. At your turn you must either pass (play no cards) or beat the previous play by playing a higher combination of the same number of cards. All plays are made by placing the cards face up in the centre of the table, so that a heap is formed. This continues for several circuits if necessary, until all but one of the players pass in succession, no one being able or willing to beat the last play. When this happens, the heap of played cards is set aside face down (or in many places, the players just leave all the played cards in a face-up heap on the table). The person who played highest (all the others having passed) begins again by playing any card or legal combination of cards.\nYou are never under any obligation to beat a card or set of cards just because you are able to - you may always choose to pass and keep your high cards for a better opportunity. Passing does not prevent you from playing when your turn comes round again. \nExample: At a late stage in a game, South starts with a 4, East beats it with a jack, you (North) pass, West plays an ace, South and East pass. You suspect that West will be able to win by playing all her remaining cards as a group if you pass, so you now play your 2, which you held back before.\nEveryone is allowed to know how many cards the other players have in their hands at any time - if asked you must answer truthfully.\nThe first player who succeeds in playing all the cards in their hand wins. As soon as this happens, the play ends and the hand is scored. (The other players do not get a chance to get rid of cards by beating the final card(s) played by the winner.)\nScoring\nThe players other than the winner score penalty points for the cards remaining in their hands. The penalty is one point per card in your hand if you have 9 cards or fewer, two points per card if you have 10, 11 or 12 cards, and three points per card (i.e. 39 points) if you have all 13 of your cards left at the end, because you never played any cards at all. The winner, having no cards, gets no penalty points for the hand.\nThis game is often played for money. In this case, before starting to play the players agree a stake - for example $1 per point - and at the end of the session each pair of players settles up according to the difference between their scores. When playing for money, if the person playing after you has only one card left, you should take precautions as follows to hinder them from winning:\n\nIf single cards are being played, you should play your highest card.\nIf it is your turn to lead, you should lead a combination more than one card if possible; otherwise you should lead your highest card.\n\nIf you ignore these precautions, and as a result the person after you wins by playing their single card, you have to pay the losses of all three players. \nVariations\nThere are many, many variations of Big Two - in fact I have not seen any two independent descriptions of the rules that agree completely. \nOne Chinese web site (GameSky - unfortunately no longer in existence), used the names Da Lao Er and Bu Bu Gao Sheng for a slightly different game from the one described here, which they called Choi Dai Dee. According to this site, in Dao Lao Er or Bu Bu Gao Sheng there are no flushes, and a full house cannot be used to beat a straight. Four of a kind or a straight flush can be played out of turn to beat any combination. When someone wins the others score 1 per card if they have 10 or fewer cards, or 2 per card if they have 11 or more.\nDirection of play\nSome people play clockwise - I believe this is especially common in America, where virtually all card games are played in that direction. Harold Hutabarat tells me that clockwise play is usual in Indonesia. Some people play alternate hands anticlockwise and clockwise, which neutralises the advantage or disadvantage of playing next after a certain opponent. (The person playing immediately after a weak player is at an advantage).\nDealing and starting the play\nMany groups omit the procedure for deciding who receives the first card of the deal - the deal simply begins with the player to dealer\'s right (if playing anticlockwise) and therefore ends with the dealer.\nIn many groups, instead of the holder of the lowest card (normally the 3) playing the first card after each new deal, this only applies in the very first deal of a session. Thereafter the winner of each hand plays first in the next.\nSome play that when the holder of the lowest card starts, this lowest card does not have to be included in the first play.\nOthers play that the \'loser\' of each hand plays first in the next - the loser being the player who had most cards at the end of the play. If there is a tie for most cards, then those involved in the tie must expose their cards and each form the largest playable combination that they can from their cards. The next dealer and starter will be the player whose combination has the smallest number of cards, or in case of equality the weakest of these combinations.\nIn Indonesia, the game is played in "rounds" of ten deals. Only the first deal of the round is begun by the 3. The next nine deals are started by whoever won the previous deal, and this player can begin with any legal card or combination. After each round (10 deals) is completed, all the cards are placed face down and each player draws one card. The highest will shuffle the cards and deal the player with 3 will start the play of this first deal of the new round.\nOrder of suits\nIn the game Pusoy Dos, played in the Philippines, the order of suits from high to low is diamonds, hearts, spades, clubs. In this case it is the player who holds the 3 rather than the 3 who starts.\nSome players in Taiwan and a few in Hong Kong interchange clubs and diamonds, so that the order is spades (high), hearts, diamonds, clubs (low) - as in Bridge. In this case the 3 starts.\nUse of twos and aces in straights and straight flushes\nSome play that A-2-3-4-5 is the highest, rather than the lowest type of straight or straight flush. Some play that 2-3-4-5-6 is highest, beating A-2-3-4-5, which in turn beats A-K-Q-J-10. Some play that 2-3-4-5-6 is highest, but A-2-3-4-5 is lowest.\nSome do not allow A-2-3-4-5 as a valid straight or straight flush at all. Some allow twos to rank high in these combinations, so that 2-A-K-Q-J is valid and is the highest type of straight or straight flush and 6-5-4-3-2 is lowest. \nYet others count 6-5-4-3-2 as second highest, between 2-A-K-Q-J and A-K-Q-J-10. The logic behind this ranking is that you compare the cards in descending order of their normal rank, so 2AKQJ beats 26543 because ace beats 6, and 26543 beats AKQJT because 2 beats ace.\nSome simply play that for straights and straight flushes, the cards rank from 2 (high) to 3 (low) and twos and threes are never consecutive, so that the highest type of straight is 2-A-K-Q-J and the lowest is 7-6-5-4-3. Karl Boehnker tells me that this version is the most common one in Hong Kong.\nIn Indonesia, straights containing a two (A-2-3-4-5 and 2-3-4-5-6) beat all other straights, and between each other they are ranked according to the suit of the two (A-2-3-4-5 beats 2-3-4-5-6, which beats A-2-3-4-5).\nRanking of flushes\nSome play that the rank of a flush is determined by the rank of its highest card; the suit only becomes relevant if the highest cards are equal. So for example 2-J-7-5-3 beats A-J-10-7-6, which beats A-K-J-9-8. This is the usual version played in Hong Kong.\nSome compare all the ranks first, from the top card downward, as in Poker. Only if all five ranks are equal does the suit of the highest card determine which flush is higher. Using this method, A-K-J-9-8 beats A-J-10-7-6 because the king is higher than the jack.\nOrder of royal flush, quads and straight flush\nSome play that only a Royal Flush (A-K-Q-J-10) can beat a four of a kind. Any four of a kind beats any other straight flush. So A-K-Q-J-10 beats 2-2-2-2-6, which beats 3-3-3-3-8, which beats K-Q-J-10-9.\nPlaying without triples and flushes\nSome play without triples and flushes - I have one report of this from Singapore (Gary Chan) and one from Taiwan (Todd Latta). So only single cards, pairs and 5-card combinations can be played and the only 5-card combinations are straight, full house, four of a kind, and straight flush.\nPlaying quads without an odd card\nSome allow four of a kind can be played by itself, without a fifth card. In this case fours form a separate type of combination, which can only beat lower fours and be beaten by higher fours.\nHonour hands beat all combinations\nAn honour hand is a four of a kind plus a card or a straight flush. Some allow an honour hand to be played not only to beat a lower 5-card hand, but also to beat singles pairs or triples.\nplayed it.  Jonathan Dushoff reports that this variation is common in Lukang (central Taiwan).\nTwo extra cards with a straight flush\nIn Todd Latta\'s version, a straight flush is played with any two extra cards, making a seven card combination. A four of a kind plus a card or a straight flush plus two cards can be played to beat any single card or other combination. A four of a kind plus a card can only be beaten by a higher four plus a card or a straight flush plus two, and a straight flush plus two is only beaten by a higher straight flush plus two.\nDragon wins\nIn Hong Kong, some play that a player who is dealt a dragon, which is one card of each rank: A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K, immediately wins the game. Each of the other players scores as though they lost without playing any cards (39 penalty points).\nNo Play after a Pass\nIn Indonesia, a player who has passed is not allowed to play cards in subsequent turns of the same trick. Having passed, you cannot play again until a card or combination is passed by all players and the play is restarted. If you play a card or combination and no one else beats it, you are allowed to beat your own cards. In this case, no one will be allowed to beat your second play, since they have all passed your first play. Example: you hold 3-3-8-8-10-10. You lead your 3-3 and the second player, holding 2-2 and no other pairs, decides not to waste these high cards. The other two players also pass. Now you can play your 8-8, the player with 2-2 is not allowed to play, having passed, and so you win with your 10-10.\nLast Card\nSome require that a player who has only one card left must announce this.\nSome require that if you are playing immediately before a player who has only one card you must play your highest single card or a combination of more than one card. (This could be against your interests - you might otherwise wish to help the player after you to win, so as to catch another player with a large number of cards.)\nIn Indonesia, a player with only two cards or only one card is obliged to announce this, but the next player is not placed under any constraints as a result.\nSome play that you cannot win by keeping the two of spades as your last card.\nPlaying until only one player has cards\nSome do not end the play when one player runs out of cards. Instead the others continue to play, dropping out as they run out of cards, until only one player remains. If a player\'s last card (or combination) is not beaten by any other player, the turn to start again with any legal play passes to the next player in turn after the one who has just finished.\nScoring variations\nSome play that only the winner collects money from each of the other three players, according to the number of cards each has left. there are no payments between the losers.\nSome play that the double score for having 10 or more cards at the end applies only to the starter - the person who played the first card of the deal.\nSome play with greater penalties - double score if you are left with 8 or 9 cards, triple with 10-12 and quadruple with 13 cards.\nSome reckon double penalty points for any hand with 8 or more cards when someone finishes. Some apply a further double for 10 or more cards (i.e. 40 points for 10 cards, 44 for 11 and so on). Some double the penalty yet again for each two remaining in a player\'s cards at the end. So if you had nine cards at the end including two twos you would lose 9x2x2x2=72points. \nAnthony Kam reports a variant, which may be rare, in which it is the difference between the number of cards held by each pair of players that determines whether the payment between that pair of players is doubled. For example, playing with double payments for 9-11 cards, a player with 10 cards would pay 20 stakes to the winner, but only 8 stakes to a player with two cards (because 10-2 is less than 9).\nSome simplify the scoring by simply paying one point per card, without doubling. Unfortunately this reduces the incentive for a player to take a risk in order to catch someone with a large number of cards.\nSome play that if the winner\'s last play consists entirely of twos (a single two, a pair of twos or even three twos), the penalties for the other players are doubled.\nSome count penalty points by adding up the values of cards left in the players\' hands. There are various scales of values, for example in some groups numeral cards 2-10 score 1 point each; jacks, queens and kings 2 points; aces 3 points; and twos 4 points each. Some count 1 point for a three, 2 for a four, 3 for a five, and so on up to 11 points for a king, 12 for an ace and 13 for a two. These penalty points are doubled for a player who has 10 or more cards.\nJonathan Dushoff reports a version played in Taiwan in which the winner is paid a fixed amount by the loser only. Which player is the loser is determined by looking at the remaining cards of the players other than the winner:\n\nIf anyone has a honour combination (straight plus or quads plus a card) the holder of the highest such combination loses.\nIf no one has an honour combination, the holder of the highest two or ace loses;\nIf there are no honour combinations, twos or aces, the holder of the largest number of cards loses;\nIf there are no honour combinations and there is a tie for most cards, the holder of the highest card loses even if it is lower than an ace.\n\n\n\nThe Philippine game Pusoy Dos is normally played with positive points rather than penalty points. The winner (the first player to run out of cards) normally scores 1 point and the others score nothing. However, if you win and your last play includes a deuce (two) you score 2 points; if it contains two deuces you score 4 points, if it includes three deuces you score 8 points, and if you were to win by playing all four deuces you would score 16 points.\nWhen playing the version that goes on until only one player has cards left, the person who runs out of cards first wins five points, the second player wins 3 points, the third wins 1 points and the last one gets no points.\nHarold Hutabarat reports that in Indonesia the following scoring is used:\n\nSpecial cards: The following combinations are rewarded with negative points if played during the hand and not beaten. They are worth nothing if the holder does not play them before the play finishes, or if they are played and beaten.\nFour of a kind (any but four twos):-20 points.\nStraight flush:-40 points\nFour twos:-80 points\nIf you play one of these combinations as the final cards in your hand, so ending the play, the score for it is doubled.\nThe player who finishes the game with a normal card (from 3 to Ace) or a combination of normal cards scores -5 points.  Each two used in the combination that ends the game is valued as -10; for example if you end the game with a pair of twos, then you get -20.\nThe scores of the players other than the winner are calculated as follows:\n  Each card from 3 to Ace remaining in hand scores 1 point\n  Each two remaining in hand scores 5 points.\n  A player left with 11 or 12 cards when the play ends scores double points.  If you still have all 13 cards then your score for that hand will be multiplied by three.\n  \n\n\n\nHong Kong Big Two\nIvan Ip describes a version of Big Two that he says is standard  in Hong Kong (though other variants certainly exist there). Flushes are compared according to the rank of the highest card. JQKA2 is not a valid straight or straight flush. The highest straight or straight flush is A2345, then 23456, TJQKA, 9TJQK, and so on down to 34567 (lowest).   A dragon wins the hand outright. The deal cannot be won by playing a single 2 as your last card. The second and subsequent deals are begun by the winner of the previous deal.\nThree Player Game\nSeventeen cards are dealt to each player, and the last card is placed face up in the centre of the table (one report says that this last card is dealt face down). The holder of the three of diamonds adds this extra card to their hand. If it turns out that the last face down card is the 3 then the holder of the 3 must take it. The rest of the play is as in the four-player version.\nSome play that from the second deal onwards, immediately after the deal, the loser of the previous deal must give their highest card to the winner in exchange for an unwanted card from that player. This rule applies only to the three-player game.\nSome play with only 13 cards dealt to each player. In this case the holder of the lowest dealt card starts. Anyone who passes must draw a card from the undealt stock and add it to their hand. When the stock is used up, play can continue without drawing, or in some groups the played cards that have been set aside are shuffled and used as a new stock for drawing. Some play that if you pass when a combination of cards was needed, you draw not one card but the number of cards you would have had to play.\nNormally the payment per card at the end from a player holding more than 13 cards is the same as from a player with 13 cards, usually 3 points per card.\nTwo Player Game\nPractice varies on the number of cards dealt. Some play that 17 cards are dealt to each player and the remaining 18 cards are set aside unused. Others play with 21 cards each and 10 cards unused, yet others with 13 cards each and 26 unused. The play is as in the four-player game; the holder of the lowest dealt card starts.\nSome play that a player who passes must draw a card or cards, as in the equivalent variation of the three-player game.\nOther Big Two WWW sites and software\nDescriptions of the game and variations.\n\nA paper Dai Di Analysis giving rules of Singapore Chor Dai Di and an analysis of its strategy and probabilities was produced by Teo Kai Meng, Roddy Kok Yik Siong, Jeremy Ang Kay Yong and Ivan Lim Wen Chiang in June 2000.Nicholas Cheung\'s page with rules of Choi Dai Di\nArchive copy of a page on Sikitcha - a variation of Pusoy Dos\nHere is a set of Big Two rules from mainland China.\n\nA tile version of Big Two is published by the Korean firm Dagoy under the name Lectio. It is played with plastic tiles numbered from 1 to 15 in each of the four suits, making a 5-player game possible in which each player is dealt 12 tiles. Chips are supplied for keeping score: each player is supplied 149 points\' worth of chips at the start and a game ends after 5 deals or when a player runs out of chips if that happens sooner.

The deal is unique in that all the tiles are left face down on the table in a row in front of the players.\nThe Play\nThe players draw for the lead and take turns placing tiles on either end of the train.  Doubles are played across the line, but are not spinners.\nIn his turn, each player takes one tile from the right side of his row and turns it face up.  If this is the lead for the round, it is placed in the center of the table to start the train.  Otherwise, if the tile can be played on the train, the player does so.  If the tile cannot be played on the train, the player turns it face down again and puts it on the left end of his row of tiles.\nIf a player cannot play, he passes.  The hand stops when one player dominoes or when nobody can play.  The lead for the next hand passes to the previous leader\'s left. \nScoring\nAt the end of the hand, each player gets the total number of pips in his hands.  The lowest scoring player is the winner and is credited with the sum of the scores of the losers, minus his own total.  If there is a tie for lowest score, then nobody gets a score.\nThe game is played for 100 points in a two player or partnership game, and for 61 points in a three or four handed game.  This convention allows a cribbage board to be used for keeping scores.\nBillitonnen\nThis Dutch variant is traditionally played at the end of the game of Nos to decide who will win the side pot containing the roundings. As in Nos, there are 3, 4 or 5 players. To decide who starts each player draws a tile and the highest spot value begins. In case of a tie, the tile  a higher spot value on one end counts a higher. The tiles are distributed as follows.\n\n3  players: 9 tiles each and one left over which is turned up in the centre of the table to start the layout.\n4 players: 7 tiles each\n5 players: 6 tiles each for the first three players; 5 tiles each for the other two.\n\nThe players place their tiles side by side face down in a row in front of them.\n\nWhen there are three players, the first player turns up his right hand tile and adds it to the turned up centre tile if possible, matching the ends as in ordinary dominoes. \nIf there are four or five players the first player places his right hand tile in the centre of the table to start the layout, and then turns up next tile and adds it to the line if it matches.\n\nThe same player continues to turn over tiles and add them to either end of the line, until he comes to a tile that does not fit. He places this tile at the left hand end his tiles, face down unless it is a double, in which case it is placed face up. Then it is the next player\'s turn to try to add tiles from the right hand end of his hand to the centre layout in the same way.\nA player who turns up a tile which would fit on either end of the layout is allowed to look at the next tile in his hand to help decide on which end to place the current tile.\nWhoever manages to play all his tiles first is the winner. \nOther Variants\nMost of the variations are how you turn over the tiles.  Some people allow you turn over any tile in your row, so that once you have seen all the tiles, you have full knowledge of all the tiles in play, assuming that your memory is good. \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Western Domino Games > Blind Hughie\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net) and is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       Joe Celko, John McLeod, 2001, 2015.

Most poker variants can be reversed in this way, but the name "Lowball" is most often used to refer to a low version of Five Card Draw Poker. On this page several versions of this game are described. They differ in the  hand ranking, the drawing procedure and whether a wild card is used, and these are described on this page.\nThe different possible rankings for low poker are explained on the hand ranking page. The differences depend on whether Aces are counted as high or low, and whether straights and flushes count. Paired cards always count, so in the absence of straights and flushes a hand of five different ranks always beats a hand containing any duplicate ranks.\nWhen drawing to a five-card hand to make a low hand, it is seldom worth drawing more than one card. If you draw two cards you will make a pair about half the time, and however low the three cards are that you keep, your chance of getting a 9-high or better is never more than 25%. For this reason,  there are versions of lowball  in which players have more than one opportunity to draw. In such a game you can afford to draw more than one card the first time, but if you stay for the last draw you will either stand pat or draw just one card, hoping for a low card that does not pair with any of your other four.\nAlthough Draw Poker is perhaps the most usual form of Lowball game, the  Lowball version of Five Card Stud also works well, and Seven Card Stud Low is also played under the name Razz. The name Lowball is also occasionally used to refer to the game called Jacks Back on this site, which begins as Five Card Draw Jacks or Better and is played for low if no one has a good enough hand to open.\nCalifornia Lowball\nAlso known as Ace-to-Five Single Draw, this game is similar to Five Card Draw Poker, but in the showdown the lowest hand wins, using ace-to-five ranking. That is, aces are always low and straights and flushes do not count, so the lowest hand is A-2-3-4-5, then A-2-3-4-6, A-2-3-5-6, etc. AS always the highest cards of an unpaired hand are compared first, so for example 7-5-4-3-2 beats 7-6-3-2-A.\nIt is possible to play with an ante, but in formal games it is more often played with blinds. The dealer places a small blind and the next two players to the left of the dealer each place a big blind equal to the minimum bet. \nEveryone is dealt five cards and there is a round of betting. If an ante is used this begins with the player to the left of the dealer. When blinds are placed, these count as bets and the first betting round begins with the player immediately to the left of the blinds; the players who placed big blinds are allowed to raise when the turn comes around to them even if no one else has done more than call.\nAfter the first betting round, surviving players in turn, starting to the dealer\'s left, can discard any number of cards (in practice seldom more than one card) and are dealt replacements. There is then a second round of betting. If the game is played with blinds this is started by the first active player to dealer\'s left. If there are antes and no blinds, the second round is begun by the player who opened the first round of betting.\nWhen Lowball is played as a fixed limit game, some play that the size of the bet is doubled after the draw and others play that it remains the same.\nThis game is often played with a joker added to the deck. The joker, sometimes known as the fitter, represents the lowest rank not present in the holder\'s hand. For example 8-6-4-A-joker is equivalent to 8-6-4-2-A.\nBetting Sevens\nSome play that a player who checks after the draw with a hand that is 7-low or better (five different ranks with nothing higher than a 7) and has the best hand at the showdown can only win the chips that were in the pot at the time of the draw. Any chips that were bet after the draw are placed in a separate pot that this player is not eligible to win.\nBetting, calling a bet or raising after the draw entitles you to win the whole pot with your 7-low or better  if you have the best hand at the showdown, provided that you did not check at your first turn to act after the draw. It is therefore unwise to check after the draw with such a hand, unless you intend to fold if another player bets against you.\nKansas City Lowball\nKansas City Lowball is also called Deuce to Seven Single Draw or sometimes Billy Baxter Lowball after the player who won the world championship \nin this game several times.  In this game, Aces are always high and \nstraights and flushes do count (and are therefore bad), but A-2-3-4-5 \nis not a straight, because the Ace is high.  The best hand possible is 7-5-4-3-2 (hence "Deuce\nto Seven"), followed by 7-6-4-3-2, ... K-Q-J-10-8, A-5-4-3-2, A-6-4-3-2, \n... up to the usual royal flush, which is worst.  In other words, it\'s the exact \nopposite of normal high poker except for the A-2-3-4-5 rule.\nThe deal, draw and betting are similar to California Lowball. So far as I know, this game is normally played without a joker, and there is no equivalent of the "betting sevens" rule.\nThe Deuce to Seven page of the Play Lowball Poker site has further information on this game.    \nAce-to-Six Lowball\nThis is Five Card Draw Poker using ace-to-six ranking, in which straights and flushes count but aces can be low. Normally A-A should be the lowest (and therefore best) pair, but A-K-Q-J-10 would count as a straight - but opinions may differ, so these details should be agreed in advance among the players. \nThis game is often ignored or said to be unusual in books and on poker web sites. This may be because it is not played in public card rooms on the American West Coast and rarely offered as an online game. However, I suspect it is fairly widespread in home poker games, particularly on the American East Coast and in Europe.\nTriple Draw\nIn this game players have three opportunities to improve their hand. According to some sources the maximum number of players for this game is six. Certainly with a larger number of players the cards will frequently run out and discards will need to be recycled.\nNormally it is played with blinds: the player to dealer\'s left posts a small blind, and the next player to the left posts a big blind, equal to the mimimum bet for the game. \nThe dealer deals five cards to each player and there is a round of betting beginning to the left of the big blind. As usual in games with blinds, the big blind player is allowed to raise even if the others have all folded or called. Then in clockwise order, starting to dealer\'s left, players may discard any number of cards and are dealt replacements. There is a second round of betting begun by the first active player to dealer\'s left. This is followed by a second opportunity to discard and draw, a third round of betting, a third discard and draw, and a fourth round of betting. In a fixed limit game, the size of the bet is normally doubles after the second draw, so that the last two rounds have big bets.\nIt happens fairly often in this game that the dealer runs out of cards. In this case all the discarded cards (the "muck") are shuffled and cut to form a new deck from which replacement cards are dealt to players who are still waiting to draw.\nThere are two versions of this game, depending on the hand ranking used in the showdown (see low poker hand ranking):\n\nDeuce to Seven Triple Draw, which uses deuce-to-seven ranking, is perhaps the more popular game.\nAce to Five Triple Draw, using ace to five ranking is also sometimes played.\n\nThe Triple Draw page of the Play Lowball Poker site has further information on the history and variants of this game.\nDouble Draw\nThis game is similar to Triple Draw, except that players only have two opportunities to improve their hands by drawing cards. There are therefore three betting rounds: after the deal, after the first draw and after the second draw. Either ace-to-five or deuce-to-seven (or even ace-to-six) ranking can be used, as agreed by the players.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Lowball\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2010.

A caller calls numbers chosen by drawing numbered balls or tokens  from a supply, or by an electronic randomiser. Players mark any numbers on their cards that are called, and the first player to mark a complete row wins a prize.\nIt is possible to play a similar game using standard playing-cards, and this page describes several ways to do this. \nBasic Game\nTwo standard 52-card packs without jokers are used. There can be up to ten players and a caller. The caller can be one of the players or do nothing but call cards, as preferred.\nFrom one pack of cards, five cards are dealt to each player, face up. (With eight or fewer players, six cards each can be dealt if preferred.) The caller draws cards one at a time from the other pack and calls out their rank and value - for example "five of diamonds". The holder (if any) of the called card turns it face down. The first player to turn all their cards face down wins. If playing for money, the winner\'s hand should be checked against the other pack to make sure all its cards have in fact been called.\nThis game is also known in some places as Bango! or Hoy! according to the word to be shouted by a player to announce that they have won.\nThirteen Card Bingo\nBy adding more packs of cards it is possible to play the above game with more players and larger hands. I have seen a version played in the Doncaster Whist Club in England by about 60 people. There were four players and a pack of cards at each table, and these were dealt out, thirteen to each player, as for Whist. As in the basic game, the caller calls cards from a separate pack, and the first player whose 13 cards are all called claims a prize.\nBingo without Suits\nThis is the same as the basic game, except that the caller calls only the rank of the card - "eight", "king", etc., suits being ignored. When a rank is called, players turn down all the cards they hold of that rank. In this version it is possible for two players to win simultaneously. Either they share the prize or you could play that the prize goes to whoever is first to claim a win.\nBingo with Payment for Uncalled Cards\nThis variant, played in Canada, is described by Cheryle Kaus on the Bingo page of her 52pickup.net site. Only one deck of cards is used and suits are ignored. The game is probably best for around 3 to 5 players. Before each deal, each player puts a stake into the pot. Five cards are then dealt face down to each player and ten face down to the middle of the table. Players look at their hands and if any player has four cards of the same rank, all the cards are shuffled and redealt.\nThe dealer turns the cards in the middle face up one at a time, and the players discard any cards they hold that match the rank of a face-up card in the middle. Players\' discards should be kept in front of them so that they can be checked. If the dealer turns up a card of a rank that has already appeared, further cards are turned up from the undealt portion of the deck until a card of a new rank is found (or until the deck runs out).\nA player who manages to discard all his or her cards shouts bingo and wins. All players then place one more stake in the pot for each card that they have not discarded, and the winner collects the pot.\nIf no one wins, the dealer  continues turning cards until ten different ranks have been turned up. Each player then pays one stake to the pot for each card they have not discarded, everyone adds another stake for the new deal, and the cards are shuffled and dealt again. Further hands are played until someone wins the pot.\nBingo with a Jackpot\nThis British variant, reported by Craig Crossland\nof Love to Play Bingo, is played with two 52-card packs without jokers, with a maximum of four players. Suits are ignored in this version.\nBefore each deal, each player contributes one stake to the main pot and two stakes to the jackpot. The two decks are shuffled together, and the dealer deals 6 cards face down to each player and 12 face down to the "jackpot pile". Cards are dealt one at a time to the players with two placed in the jackpot pile at the end of each rotation.\nThe dealer turns up cards from the jackpot pile one at a time and calls their ranks. Players discard all cards they hold that are equal in rank to the turned up card. Any player who manages to discard all his or her cards callds "bingo!" and collects the main pot and the jackpot.\nIf the jackpot pile is exhausted and no one has won, the dealer continues by turning up cards from the undealt portion of the pack and calling their ranks. As before, players discard any cards they hold that are equal to the turned card. A player who discards all his or her cards calls "bingo!" and collects the main pot only. The jackpot remains for the next deal and will have more money added to it.\nIf the whole pack runs out and no one has called bingo, there is no winner. Both pots are carried over to the next deal with further stake money added by all players.\nIf two or more players call "bingo!" on the same card, the money from the pot or pots they win is shared equally between them.\nBingo with Betting Rounds\nThe Wikipedia page on Card Bingo describes a game with poker-like betting rounds. One 52-card pack is used and suits are ignored. The players place an ante and five cards are dealt to each player and five face down to the table. The five table cards are turned face up one at a time, with a betting round before each is exposed. Players discard any cards equal to the turned up card. The first player to discard all five cards wins the pot. If no player achieves this after all five cards have been turned up, the winner is determined by adding up the values of remaining cards in players\' hands. Two to ten are face value. Players need to agree in advance:\n\nthe value of the jack, queen and king - could be 10, 10, 10 or 11, 12, 13;\nthe value of an ace - could be 1, 11 or 15;\nwhether the winner is the player with the highest total card values remaining or the lowest.\n\nHigh-Low Bingo\nThis variation is described on Cheryle Kaus\' Bingo page. It is similar to the betting game above, but played with two 52-card packs shuffled together and suitable for a larger number of players. A player who discards all five cards calls "bingo!" and wins the whole pot. If no one has declared "bingo!" after the five table cards have been turned up, the pot is split between the highest and lowest value hands, counting picture cards as 10 and aces as 1 for the low hand and 11 for high.\nIn Cheryle Kaus\' version, apparently it is the total value of all five of a player\'s cards that are counted, so players need to keep their discards in front of them.\nAlternatively, it would also be possible to play a similar high-low game in which the discarded cards were lost from the players\' hands and only the remaining cards were counted in the high-low competition for the pot.  \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Banking Games > Card Bingo\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2011.

It is related to Bezique and was popular at the end of the 19th century.  This is a trick taking card game adapted to dominoes, but it is fairly complex in itself.\nEquipment\nThe game uses a double six domino set, two players and a cribbage board, chips or pad for scoring.\nThe Deal\nThe lead for the first hand is picked by drawing a tile or other method.  Afterwards, the lead alternates between the two players.\nEach player gets a hand of seven tiles, and then the second player turns one tile in the bone yard face up.  The high end of this tile determines the trump for this hand.  This tile stays face up for the rest of the hand. \nThe Play\nThe game is played for tricks, like a card game.  The first player leads and the second is under no obligation to follow suit until one of the players "closes the game", which will be explained shortly, or the boneyard is empty.\nA trick is won by:\n\n\nPlaying the [0-0] tile, which is called the Bingo.  This tile always beats everything else.  \nAny trump tile beats any non-trump tile.  A higher trump beats a lower trump.  The double of the trump suit is the highest tile in the deck.  \nPlaying a higher tile in the same suit.  This rule also applies to playing a higher trump tile.  \nIf neither tile is a trump, then the tile with the highest number of pips wins the trick.  \nIf neither tile is a trump and both tiles have the same number of pips, then the first tile played wins the trick.\n \n\n\nAfter each trick the winner draws a replacement tile from the boneyard and leads the next trick.  You cannot draw the face up tile that determined trump.  If the boneyard is reduced to two tiles (the face up tile and the last face down tile), the face up tile goes to the winner of the last trick in the game and the other player gets the face down tile.\nClosing a game\nWhen one player believes that he can score 70 or more points without drawing tiles from the boneyard, he announces that he is closing the game and turns the face tile in the boneyard face down.  Neither player can draw from the boneyard at this point.\nFrom this trick until the rest of the game, the players are obligated to follow fixed rules of play.\n\nIf a trump is lead, then you must play a trump if possible.  \nIf a trump is lead and you have no trumps, you may play any tile you wish.  \nIf a non-trump is lead, then you must play a tile that matched the higher end of the tile which was lead.  \nIf a non-trump is lead and you cannot play a tile that matches the higher end of the tile which was lead, then you must play a tile that matched the lower end of the tile which was lead.  \nIf none of the preceding four rules applies, then you may play any tile in your hand.\n\nIf a player closes a game but fails to make 70 points for the rubber, both players get the points they made during the hand, but his opponent gets two rubbers in addition.\nScoring\nThe game is played for rubbers (also called games points or sets in some sources).  A player scores a rubber when he has made another 70 points, so there is no fixed number of hands needed to score a rubber.  As an aside, in the card game Sixty-six, the numbers of points needed for a rubber was 66, and hence the name of that game.  The game is played for seven rubbers.  Points from tricks are scored at the end of each hand, but the other points are scored as they are called out by the player.\nAuthors are not clear on how to count points to make rubbers, so I will present a system based on the points of agreement found in several of the references.\nPoints are scored by taking tricks with (1) special tiles and (2) tiles in the trump suit.  The special tiles are:\n\n[0-0] Bingo = 14 Points\n[0-3] Little three = 10 Points\n[6-4] Big ten = 10 Points\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the blank count 7 points each on the scoring tiles.\n\nThe double of Trumps is always worth 28 points, no matter what the suit.  \nDoubles which are not trump are worth the total of their pips.  \nAll other trumps are worth the total of their pips \nA tile is counted only once as a trump, double or special tile.  For example, if one was the trump suit, then the non-trump doubles would be worth a total of 40 points and the Bingo would 14 points:\n\n\n[0-0] = 14 \n[2-2] =  4 \n[3-3] =  6 \n[4-4] =  8 \n[5-5] = 10 \n[6-6] = 12\nThe trumps would be worth a total of 61 points \n\n[1-0] =  8 \n[1-1] = 28 \n[1-2] =  3 \n[1-3] =  4 \n[1-4] =  5 \n[1-5] =  6 \n[1-6] =  7 \nThe special tiles would be 20 points, since they are not part of the trump suit.  \n\n[0-3] = 10 \n[4-6] = 10 \nHere is a table of the possible points for each trump suit:\n\nSuittrumpsdoublesspecialstotal\n\n0914210143\n1615420135\n2665220138\n3715010131\n4764820144\n5814620147\n6864410140\n\nYou can also score points during play by showing doubles.  To this the player must play one double on the trick and win the trick.  If he does not win the trick, he cannot score for the doubles in his hand.  He then collects the trick, announces the number of doubles he wishes to score, and expose the other double(s) in his hand.  After the points are recorded, the unplayed double(s) are returned to his hand. \ntwo doubles=20 points (called a double)\nthree doubles=40 points (called a triplet)\nfour doubles=50 points (called a double double)\nfive doubles=60 points (called a King) \nsix doubles=70 points or a rubber (called an Emperor) \nseven doubles=200 points or three rubbers (called an Invincible) \nIf one of the doubles is the Bingo, then add another 10 points to the score in the above table (this means that an invincible is always worth 210 points). \nThere is disagreement among the authors as to whether the Emperor and the Invincible give you rubbers directly or first give you points.  Since these hands are very rare and the net effect is going to be the same, it is a minor point.\n\nIf a player reaches 70 after his opponent has 30 or more points, he gets one rubber.  Some authors say 20 points instead.  \nIf a player reaches 70 before his opponent reaches 30 points, he gets two rubbers.  Some authors say 20 points instead.  \nIf a player reaches 70 before his opponent has any score, he gets three rubbers.  \nIf a player wins the double trump with the Bingo, he gets one rubber.  \nIf one player closes a game, but fails to make 70 points for the rubber, then both players get the points they made during the hand, but the opponent of the failed closer gets two rubbers in addition. \n\nVariants\nGyles Brandreth\'s THE WORLD\'S BEST INDOOR GAMES gives a set of rules which are the same as those given here.\nVariant One\nAnother version of the game appeared in Fredrick Berndt\'s THE DOMINO BOOK (Bantam Books; ISBN 0-84-07601-4; 1975).  It is simpler than the traditional scoring system, has fewer points per hand to score and tends to make the choice of trumps less important because the total scores possible are closer for all trumps.\nBrendt\'s scoring system is simple, but not really good.  The lack of special tiles is a radical departure from the original game.  The zero trump game can occur only when the Bingo is drawn from the boneyard, making it both the rarest and the lowest scoring game, which is counter-intuitive.  Berndt seems to be attempting to stay closer to the original card game of Sixty-six.\nThe Traditional system gives higher scores and thus can be played faster than Berndt\'s version of the game.  But the scoring is so different that they are really two different games.\nThe play is the same, but the scoring is done with these rules:\n\nSpecial tiles: There are no points for the [4-6] or [0-3] tiles.  \nTrumps: Trumps score only the number of pips on their non-trump end.  This means that a suit trump is always worth the non-suit ends (0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 plus the suit number.\n\nThis leads to a table of possible point which looks like this:\n\nSuittrumpsdoublestotal\n\n0211839\n1221840\n2231841\n3241842\n4251843\n5261844\n6271845\n\nDoubles: \n\n\nYou can only expose one double in play and you score 3 points for it.  There are no points for Kings, Emperors or Invincible.  \nThe double of trumps counts the total of its pips.  \nNon-trump doubles are 3 point each\n\n\nBerndt also uses 66 points as the score to receive a rubber, instead of 70 points.  He gives no bonuses for arriving at 70 points before your opponent.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Western Domino Games > Bingo (dominoes)\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net).\n      \n       Joe Celko 2001.

Similar games are played in some other countries, and there are  separate pages about:\n\nthe Italian card game Burraco\nthe Argentinean tile game Burako\n\nBuraco is a game related to Canasta, and in some ways similar to Samba, in that the aim is to meld combinations of seven or more cards that can be either sets of equal rank or sequences in a suit. Like several of the newer games of this family it also features a second hand of cards which is picked up by the first member of a partnership who disposes of all the cards from their first hand.\nBuraco originated in South America, probably in the 1940\'s, and is still widely played there. A similar game Burako is played in Argentina using tiles instead of cards, and since the 1990\'s a variation Burraco has become extremely popular  in Italy. \nSeveral versions of Buraco are played in Brazil, where the game is also known as Canastra, Biriba or Perida. Buraco Aberto (open buraco) will be described first, then the differences in Buraco Fechado (closed buraco), and finally  some other variants.\nPlayers and Cards\nThere are normally 4 players in two fixed partnerships. The deal and play are clockwise. A 108-card pack is used, consisting of two standard 52-card packs with four wild jokers, known as curingo. The twos, known as curinga can be used either as wild cards or as natural twos in sequences. The card values are:\n\n Each joker: 20 points\n Each two: 10 points\n Each ace: 15 points\n Each K, Q, J, 10, 9 or 8: 10 points\n Each 7, 6, 5, 4 or 3: 5 points.\n\nDeal\nThe first dealer is chosen by drawing cards and thereafter the turn to deal passes to the left. The player to dealer\'s right cuts the cards and forms two 11-card piles (mortos) from the cut portion: these are put aside to be taken by the first player of each team who runs out of cards. The dealer deals the cards one at a time from the remainder of the pack: 11 to each player. The remaining 42 cards are stacked face down to form the draw pile (monte). The game begins with the discard pile (lixo or bagao) empty.\nMelds\nThe aim of the game is to score points by putting down melds. Each team keeps its melds together. Players can add cards to their own team\'s melds but not to melds put down by their opponents.\nA meld consists of a sequence (seguida) of three or more consecutive cards of a suit. For this purpose the cards rank A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A. It is possible to have a 14-card sequence with an ace at each end. A meld can contain at most one wild card (a joker or a two) as a substitute for a missing card. A two of the correct suit can alternatively be used as a natural card, immediately below the three, and it is possible for a sequence to contain a wild two or joker in addition to a natural two.\nA sequence that contains a wild card is dirty (suja): a sequence consisting entirely of natural cards is clean (limpa). A sequence of seven or more cards is called a canastra, and the team scores a bonus for this.\nIn Buraco Aberto there are no sets of equal cards, only sequences.\nPlay\nThe first player, to the right of the dealer, takes the top card of the draw pile, looks at it, and decides whether or not to keep it. The options for the first player are:\n\nKeep the first card; possibly put down one or more melds; discard one card from hand face up to end the first player\'s turn.\nDiscard the first card face up; take a second card from the draw pile; possibly put down one or more melds; discard a second card face up on top of the first to end turn.\n\nThereafter, the turn to play passes counter-clockwise and each turn consists of:\n\nTaking either the top card of the face-down draw pile or the whole of the face-up discard pile.\nOptionally putting down melds or adding cards to melds already put down by the player\'s team.\nDiscarding one card face up on the discard pile.\n\nIn this open game, the cards of the discard pile are overlapped, so that all their values can be seen.\nNote: the special procedure for the first player is almost equivalent to having turned up a card after the deal to start the discard pile and giving the first player a normal turn, choosing between this and drawing an unknown card from the stock pile. The only real difference is that if the first player keeps the first card drawn, the other players do not know what it was.\nThe first player who  gets rid of the last card from his or her hand picks up takes the first morto of 11 cards to use as a new hand. The second morto is taken by the first player of the other team who runs out of cards. Running out of cards is known as a batida and there are two types:\n\nbatida direta (or batida seco)  in which all the player\'s cards are melded. The player picks up the morto and carries on melding, until the turn is ended by discarding from the new hand.\nbatida indireta: when  a player discards his or her last card to  claim a morto, the new 11-card hand cannot be used until the player\'s next turn. \n\nWhen a team has taken its morto, either player of that team can end the play with a second batida if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\nThe player melds all but one card from hand, and discards this last card.\nThe team has melded at least one canastra limpa - a clean sequence of seven or more cards without a wild card.\n\nIf the draw pile runs out before both the mortos have been taken, then a morto is converted into a new draw pile of 11 cards, and play continues. If the draw pile becomes empty and both mortos have been used, the play ends. The turn of the player who took the last morto is completed, and the points are then counted.\nScoring\nWhen the play ends, both teams score as follows:\n\n\ncards in melds on the table\nplus card value\n\n\ncards in players\' hands\nminus card value\n\n\ncanastra limpa  (clean sequence of 7+ cards)\n200 points extra\n\n\ncanastra suja (7+ card sequence including wild card)\n100 points extra\n\n\ncanastra meia real (clean 13-card sequence)\n500 points extra\n\n\ncanastra real (clean 14-card sequence)\n1000 points extra\n\n\nfor going out (closing)\n100 points extra\n\n\nif one team  has not taken its morto, that team scores\nminus 100 points\n\n\nIf a player takes a morto after discarding (batida indireta), but never plays a turn with it because someone else  goes out before the player\'s next turn, the team is charged the 100 point penalty for the unused morto, rather than adding up the values of the cards in it. Note that if neither team has taken its morto, the 100-point penalty does not apply to either side.\nThe game is normally played to 3000 points: when a team reaches or passes this total, the team with the higher score wins.\nA team whose cumulative score is at least half the target score (at least 1500 when playing to 3000) is said to be vulnerable. The first meld(s) put down by a vulnerable team must have a card value of at least 75 points.\nBuraco Fechado\nThis game is called "closed buraco" because the cards of the discard pile are stacked so that only the top card is visible. It is usually played with several other differences from the above rules.\n\nIt is possible to meld a set of three or more equal cards, known as a lavadeira or charuto or tripa. At most one wild card can be included in the set. A set of seven or more forms a canastra suja or canastra limpa, depending on whether it contains a wild card, and scores accordingly. It is possible to meld a set of twos, and a canastra of twos scores 1000 points.\nThe discard pile can only be taken if its top card is immediately used in a meld. This meld can include other cards from the pile, and if the team is vulnerable, meldable cards from the pile can be used towards the 75 points to justify its first meld. If the top card of the discard pile is a wild card (two or joker), the pile can only be taken is the wild card is used as part of a new meld.\nA player can go out if the player\'s team has taken its morto and made at least one canastra - the canastra does not have to be clean.\n\nVariations\nSome play to a target of 2000 or 3500 points rather than 3000.\nSome players round all scores up to a multiples of 10 - for example 485 is recorded as 490.\nSome play without vulnerability - there is no minimum meld value.\nSome play that jokers are worth 50 points each rather than 20.\nSome score 150 for a dirty canastra and 300 for a clean canastra.\nIn buraco fechado, some count any clean set of all 8 cards of a rank, such as eight 9\'s, as a canastra real, worth 1000 points.\nSome award a bonus of 100 points to the non-dealing team if the player making the cut does so in such a way as to leave exactly  44 cards, so that the dealer has exactly enough cards to deal to the players. However, when playing with this rule, if the cutter leaves the dealer with fewer than 44 cards, the cutter\'s team is charged a 100-point penalty.\nSome play that the  person who cuts the deck can look at the bottom  card from the upper portion of the cut. If that card is a joker or a 2  (that is, any  wild card), they can keep it as a card for their hand.  Dealing happens normally, but the person who cut and already has their  first card is skipped during the first dealing round.\n    \nOther Brazilian Buraco websites\nThere is a description of Buraco  on Portuguese Wikipedia\nYou can play Buraco on line at\n\nthe Brazilian Megajogos site\nThe Brazilian Jogatina site, which offers two versions of Buraco and a related game Tranca.\nThe BrazilianLudopolisite, where you can play buraco aberto and fechado, tranca and other card games.\nGame Desire\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Draw and Discard Games > Rummy Games > Buraco\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n      \n       John McLeod, 2012.

This is the game that the plain word "bridge" originally referred to, before the development of auction bridge and then today\'s contract bridge. Modern writers usually call it "straight bridge" or "bridge-whist".\nThree surviving copies of "Biritch, or Russian Whist" are known, all in the United Kingdom. One is in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, one in the Cambridge University Library and one in the Public Record Office, London. A fourth copy, which was in the British Museum Library, was destroyed in the Blitz in 1940 or 1941.\nA detailed analysis of the history of this document, the career of its author and its implications for the origins of Bridge in the Russian colony at Constantinople can be found in an article by Thierry Depaulis and Jac Fuchs, "First Steps of Bridge in the West: Collinson\'s \'Biritch\'", The Playing-Card, Vol. 32, no. 2, Sep.-Oct. 2003, pp. 67-76. According to this article, John Collinson (1842-1922) trained as an engineer and in the early 1880\'s was involved as a consultant in planning and building the Mersina, Tarsus and Adana railway in Turkey. In a letter to The Saturday Review dated 28 May 1906, Collinson wrote: "Between 1880-4 I spent a considerable time in Constantinople and Asia Minor, where I played what was then called \'Biritch or Russian Whist\'. I was then living, while in England, at Cromwell Road and introduced the game to many of my English friends, who liked it so much that they asked me to have the rules printed. ... \'Biritch\' was attributed to the Russian colony at Constantinople; in my time the dominating social and political element." According to the registration at the Stationers\' Hall (whose documents are now kept at the Public Record Office) the booklet containing the promised rules was published on 9th July 1886.\nThe transcription below, made by Mark Brader, is from the copy in the Bodleian Library. The document does not have any of the physical forms that we would expect today. It is actually a miniature bound book, containing 56 pages (28 sheets) of paper about 3 by 5 inches between fairly hard covers. The covers are plain brown with no writing visible; the spine is covered with the library\'s tape (on which they have written the title, a catalog number, and the date 1886). No author\'s name is given, and of the 56 pages, only 4 have anything printed on them -- the first 2 and the last 50 are blank.\nSpelling, punctuation, capitalization, and italics are reproduced verbatim. Headings in the original are centered, and below the main title in the original is a decorative line of Maltese crosses. Some tables are reproduced as monospaced text in order to protect the alignment. Ditto marks in the tables in the original take a form resembling a double comma, or a closing double quote moved down to the baseline, and hence are shown as double commas here.\n\nBIRITCH, OR RUSSIAN WHIST.\n+ + + + + + + + +\nVALUE OF THE CARDS\nThe value of the cards is the same as at short whist.\nTricks are taken in the same manner, and the odd tricks, over and above six, are counted as at short whist.\nMETHOD OF PLAYING.\nThere are four players as at short whist, the cutting for partners, shuffling and dealing is the same, except that no card is turned up for trumps.\nThe dealer, after the cards have been looked at, has the option of declaring the suit he elects for trumps, or of saying "pass," in which latter case his partner must declare a suit for trumps.\nIn either case of the dealer or his partner declaring, the one declaring may, instead of declaring trumps, say "biritch," which means that the hands shall be played without trumps.\nAfter the declaration of trumps, or "biritch," either of the adversaries may say "contre," in which case the value of all tricks taken is doubled, the dealer or his partner may however thereupon say "sur contre," in which latter case the value of all the tricks taken is quadrupled, and so on ad infinitum the doubling of the last established value may go on until one side ceases to call a "sur" to the previous "sur contreing."\nWhen the declaration has been made, and the "contreing" and "sur contreing" (if any) have ceased, the person to the left of the dealer leads a card.\nThen the partner of the dealer exposes all his cards, on the table, which are played by the dealer as at Dummy Whist.\nNo suggestions as to play may be made by the one standing out (Dummy) to the dealer.\nA revoke counts the same as at Short Whist, but the exposed hand cannot revoke.\nA misdeal does not change the deal, but in such cases the cards must be re-shuffled, re-cut, and re-dealt.\nAfter each rubber there is a fresh cut for partners.\nGAMES AND RUBBERS.\nA game is won by the first side which scores in play 30 points. The honours do not score towards the game.\nThe Rubber consists, as at Short Whist, of two games out of three.\nSCORING.\nThe odd tricks count as follows:--\n\nIf "Biritch" is declared   .  .   .  .  each 10 points.\n,, "Hearts" are made trumps      .  .   ,,   8   ,,\n,, "Diamonds"    ,,    ,,        .  .   ,,   6   ,,\n,, "Clubs"       ,,    ,,        .  .   ,,   4   ,,\n,, "Spades"      ,,    ,,        .  .   ,,   2   ,,\n\nIf all the tricks are taken by one side they add 40 extra points. This is called "Grand Slamm."\nIf all the tricks but one are taken by one side they add 20 extra points. This is called "Petit Slamm."\nThe winners of each rubber add 40 points to their score. This is called "Consolation."\nThere are four honours if "Biritch" is declared, which are the four aces.\nEquality in aces counts nothing.\n\n             3 aces  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  = 3 tricks.\n             4  ,,      .  .  .  .  .  .  = 4   ,,\n             4  ,,  in one hand  .  .  .  = 8   ,,\n\nThere are five honours, viz:--Ace, King, Queen, Knave and Ten, if trumps are declared.\n\n             Simple honours (3)  .  .  = 2 tricks.\n             4        ,,      .  .  .  = 4   ,,\n             4        ,, (in one hand) = 8   ,,\n             5        ,,   .  .  .  .  = 1 trick\n                 additional to the score for four honours.\n\nThe honour points are of equal value to the other points, except that they do not affect the games or rubbers, and are not doubled by a "contre."\nIf one hand has no trumps (trumps having been declared) his side, in the case of it scoring honours, adds the value of simple honours to its honour score, or, in the case of the other side scoring honours, the value of simple honours is deducted from the latter\'s score. This is called "Chicane."\n\nThe original document and this transcription are in the public domain.

Face up spades do not count, so for example if the ace of spades is dealt face up, the king of spades in the hole is sure to win half the pot.\nThe cards are dealt as in seven card stud: two cards face down, four cards face up  and the last card face down. There are five betting rounds: one after each round of face up cards and one after the final card. Each betting round is begun by the player with the highest hand showing.\nAfter the final betting round the active players declare whether they are going for highest (face down) spade, highest hand or both. A player declaring both wins only if holding both the highest spade and the highest hand. Declaration can be either in sequence, starting to the left of the dealer, or simultaneous, using chips.\nYou must have a spade face down to be eligible to win the spade half of the pot. Without this, you cannot declare spade and win, even if all the other players are going for high.\nVariants\nIn Low Chicago the pot is split between the lowest spade (ace counting high) and the highest hand (it is not a low poker game). Similar games can of course be played using any suit: for example in High or Low San Francisco the high hand splits the pot with the highest or lowest heart.\nFollow the Queen\nThis is seven card stud in which when a queen is dealt face up, the next card dealt face up and the other three cards of the same rank become wild for all players. For example a player gets the Q face up and the next player is dealt the 7 face up: all sevens are now wild. If another queen is dealt face up, the previous wild card is cancelled, and the face up card following the new queen becomes wild instead. If the last face up card dealt is a queen, there are no wild cards. In the showdown the highest hand wins.\nVariants\nSome play that all queens in the hole are wild. In this version there can be as many as seven wild cards in play: three concealed queens and four wild cards created by an exposed queen.\nSome play that if no queens are dealt face up, no one wins and there is a new deal, played for the same pot, involving only the players who did not fold on the deal without a face up queen.\nSome play that if the last card dealt face up is a queen., the dealer deals one further card face up. This card belongs to no one, but the other three cards of the same rank are wild.\nDirty Schultz\nThis is similar to Follow the Queen, except that the event that causes the next card to become wild is the appearance of a natural pair among any player\'s face up cards.\nSo whenever a card is dealt face up that is the same rank as another face up card held by that player, the next card that is dealt becomes wild (as do all cards that are equal to it), and the previous wild card (if any) ceases to be wild.  If the very last face up card that is dealt creates a pair, then there nothing at all is wild.\nTwo details need to be clarified before playing this variant:\n\nWhat happens if a player who has a wild card face up is dealt a second (equal) wild card face up? My suggestion: these cards are equal so they count as a pair, and the next card dealt will change the wild card.\nWhat happens if a player who already has a natural pair is dealt a third equal card face up? My suggestion: this is not a new pair, so the wild card does not change. However, if a player has 5, 8 face up and 5\'s are currently wild, and the player is then dealt a second 8 face up, this pair of 8\'s is a new natural pair, and the next card dealt changes the wild card.\n\nVariants\nSome play that after a pair is dealt, the next card is immediately dealt face up to the centre of the table. This centre card belongs to no one, but all cards of the same rank as it are wild. Whenever a new pair appears, another card is dealt to the centre on top of the previous one, and this will normally change the wild card. In this version, a wild card is dealt to the centre even if the very last card dealt face up to a player is wild - so there will always be a wild card if any player has a pair showing.\nSome play that each player\'s seventh card is dealt face up, unless the player pays a  fixed price to the pot to have the seventh card dealt face down. By buying a face down card at the end you avoid the risk of changing the wild card if it pairs one of your face up cards, and also gain the advantage of having three rather than two cards concealed from the other players.\nThe Bitch\nThe Bitch in this seven card stud variant is the queen of spades. If the queen of spades is dealt face up, the deal and betting immediately stop, all the cards are thrown in and shuffled, and there is a new deal involving only those players who had not folded when the queen of spades appeared.\nIn the showdown the player with the highest hand splits the pot with the player who has the queen of spades in the hole (if any). If the queen of spades was not dealt at all the high hand wins the whole pot.\nVariants\nSome play that the queen of spades in the hole is wild. In this case the pot is not split. \nBlack Mariah\nThis name is used for at least four different variants.\n\nOften, Black Mariah is used as an alternative name for The Bitch.\nSome play Black Mariah as a variant of Follow the Queen in which if the Q is dealt face up, the play immediately ends, as in The Bitch.\nSome play Black Mariah as a seven card stud variant in which you must have the best hand and the highest spade to win the pot. The high spade can be any of your seven cards, not necessarily face down. If the best hand and the highest spade in the showdown are held by different players, or if no one has any spades, no one wins and the pot remains for the new deal, in which only the players who were in the showdown take part.\nSometimes Black Mariah is used as an alternative name for High Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Chicago\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2010, 2011.

The play is similar to 500 Rummy in that a player may take several cards from the discard pile, but there two major differences.\n\nThe first card dealt to each player is face up, and its value determines that number of cards the player will be dealt. The players therefore start with unequal sized hands.\nThere are wild cards, which along with the aces have a high value, typically 100 points. It is therefore important to meld these high-value cards, or at least to dispose of them before the end of the play. One wild card is determined by an exposed card in the dealer\'s hand, and therefore varies from deal to deal. Some versions have additional wild cards.\n\nI have collected over 25 descriptions of this game from different players, and no two of them agree in every detail. The variants affect every part of the game: the number of cards used, the deal, the card values, the wild cards, the melds that are allowed, the rules of play and the scoring. I will try to cover these variants by first describing a game that uses the commonest version of each rule, and then listing the variants I have seen.\nThe name 5000 Rummy reflects the fact that the game is often played to a target score of 5000, but many players use other targets and the game may be named accordingly: 1500 Rummy,  2000 Rummy, 2200 Rummy, 2500 Rummy, 2800 Rummy or 10000 Rummy. Other names include Backwards Rummy, Bitchin\' Rummy, Circle Rummy, Crazy Rummy (though this name is more commonly used for a different variant with fixed hand sizes), Dumbbell Rummy, Dummy Rummy, George, Hillbilly Rummy, Polish Rummy and Wild One. I would like to thank the many contributors who over several years have sent me descriptions of these different versions of this game.\nPlayers and Cards\n3 or 4 players use a standard 52-card pack; from 5 to 8 players use two 52-card packs (104 cards) shuffled together. Deal and play are clockwise.\nDeal\nThe first dealer is chosen by a random method: for example all draw cards and the lowest deals. The turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. Before the deal, the dealer shuffles and the player to dealer\'s right cuts the cards.\nInstead of dealing the cards around the table one or a few at a time as in many games, the dealer gives each player in turn their whole hand of cards before moving on to the next player. For each player, starting to the dealer\'s left:\n\nThe dealer deals one card in front of the player, face up for all to see. The rank of this card determines the number of additional cards that player will be dealt.\nThe dealer  deals the remainder of the player\'s hand face down. For example if a player\'s first card is a 7, the dealer gives the player 7 more cards face down before moving on to the next player. A player whose first card is a picture (jack, queen, king) receives 10 more cards: if the first card is an ace, the player receives 11 more cards.\n\nThe dealer will be the last to receive cards. The dealer\'s first (face up) card is wild for the current deal. For example if the dealer gets a 4 face up, the dealer takes four more cards face down, and fours are wild.\nThe dealer stacks the remainder of the cards in a neat face down pile to form a stock from which cards can be drawn. The top card of the stock is turned face up and placed next to the stock to begin the discard pile.\nAll players pick up their cards, both the face up one and the face down ones, and play begins.\nMelds\nAs in all forms of rummy, the aim is to form combinations: sets of three or more equal cards and runs of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.\n\nSets\nA set consists of three or more cards of the same rank, for example three kings or five sevens. When this game ifs played with more than one deck, a set may contain identical cards, so for example 5-5-5 is a valid set.\nRuns\nA run consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. For this purpose, the cards rank in order A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A. The ace can therefore be at the low end of a run, next to the 2, or at the high end next to the king, but not in the middle of a run.\n\nA wild card can be used as a substitute for any missing card needed to form a set or run. For example if 6\'s are wild, 8-6-10 is a valid run.\nPlay\nThe player to dealer\'s left begins, and players take turns in clockwise order around the table. A turn consists of three parts:\n\nThe player either draws the top card from the stock or takes one or more cards from the top of the discard pile. The card or cards taken are added to the player\'s hand. A player is always allowed to draw the top card from the stock or the discard pile. A player can draw more than one card from the discard pile provided that\n    \nthe deepest buried card that is taken is melded in the current turn, and\nthe player also takes all cards that are on top of (discarded later than) this deepest buried card.\n\n    A player who takes more than one card from the discard pile can meld some or all of the cards that were on top of the deepest buried card; the remainder of the cards taken are added to the player\'s hand.\nThe player may lay down (meld) valid runs and sets, and cards that extend runs and sets that have already been laid down by any player. Melded cards are always kept face up in front of the player who melded them, for scoring purposes. When adding to a set or run put down by another player, you must state which set or run you are adding it to, and the other players need to take notice of this. For example if player A has melded 6-7-8 and player B had added 9 to it, other players need to be aware that a 5 or a 10 can now be added (but not another 9), even though the 9 on the table is lying in front of player B and not  next to player A\'s  run.\nTo end the turn, the player must discard one card face up onto the discard pile. If a player takes just one card from the top of the discard pile, it is not legal to discard that same card, leaving the discard pile exactly as it was before the player\'s turn. The cards of the discard pile are overlapped, so that all can be seen.\n\n\nWild cards\nIf you hold the real card that is represented by a wild card that has been used in a run, you may meld the real card in step 2 of your turn, placing it in front of yourself. The wild card remains in place. \nCalling "rummy"\nAny card can be discarded. However, if a card is discarded which can be used to extend a set or run on the table, any player who has already melded can call "rummy", take the discard and meld it, announcing the set or run it is added to, and discard a card (if possible). The turn to play then reverts to the player whose turn to play should have been next had it not been for the "rummy" call.\nEnd of the play\nThe play can end in one of two ways:\n    \nA player has only one card left after melding and discards it, so having no cards left in hand. This is called "going out". Note that this final discard must be "unplayable": it cannot be a card that could have been added to a meld on the table. A player who has no unplayable cards has to "float" - see below.\nThere are no cards left in the stock pile, and the player whose turn it is cannot or does not wish to take a card or cards from the discard pile. \n\n\nIn either case, the play ends immediately and the hand is scored. \nFloating\nIf a player melds all his or her cards, and has nothing to discard, this does not end the play. Instead, the player "floats", holding no cards. In future turns, the player must draw a card from the stock (not from the discard pile since it is illegal to draw and discard the same card). If the card drawn is playable it must be melded and the player floats again. If it is not playable, the player discards it and goes out. A player who calls "rummy" while floating melds the card but is unable to discard, so continues to float.\n\nScoring\nPlayers score the value of all the cards they have melded. For this purpose:\n\nAces and wild cards are worth 100 points each, provided that aces are not wild;\nIf aces are wild, they are worth 200 points each;\nKings, Queens, Jacks and Tens are worth 10 points each if not wild;\nNumeral cards from 2 to 9 are worth 5 points each if not wild.\n\nAlso, if the play ended by one of the players going out, that player scores the value of all the cards remaining in the other players\' hands, which they failed to meld.\nFurther deals are played until one or more players reaches a cumulative score of 5000 or more. At that point, the player who has most points is the winner.\nVariations\nThere are numerous variations of this game: no two descriptions that I have seen agree in every detail. Below I have tried to list all the variants I have seen. Please note that some combinations of variants work better together than others, and in some places I have noted which variants should or should not be combined.\nCards, Wild Cards and Card Values\nDepending on exactly how the deal is managed, there is the possibility that some players may begin with  hands of only 3 or even 2 cards, which may be undesirable. To avoid this, some groups omit some small cards from the pack. It seems to be quite common to play without twos, so that a double deck contains 96 cards. Some take this further: I have seen variants played with 244 cards, where the lowest card is a 4, and with 2 or more decks of 36 cards containing nothing below a 6. If low cards are omitted, aces are always high in runs, next to the king.\nAnother way to avoid the smallest hands is to make all the twos permanent wild cards. In this case a player who receives a two as an upcard will be dealt another 15 or 20 cards, according to what dealing variant is used.\nMany players add jokers to the deck. These act as permanent wild cards. Some groups have other permanent wild cards such as tens or one-eyed jacks.\nTo reduce the chances of running out of cards some players add extra decks. For example three or four players can play with a double deck (with 4 jokers if used) and five or more could use a triple deck (with 6 jokers if wanted).\nSome players have a lower value of 50 for aces. If aces are 50 and wild cards are 100, then wild aces would normally be worth 150, but some groups do not allow aces to be wild - see below. Some play that wild cards are always worth 200, whether they are aces or not, and that aces are 100 when not wild. \nSome groups value 9\'s and 8\'s as 10 points instead of 5. Some have special high values for other particular cards, for example 45 for the queen of spades.\nDealing and Choosing the Wild Card\nSome groups treat the face up card dealt to each player as indicating the total number of cards that player should receive, rather than the number of additional cards. In this version, for example, a player who was dealt a 6 first would get only 5 cards face down, not 6.\nIn some groups a jack indicates 11 cards, a queen 12 cards and a king 13 cards, rather than pictures all indicating 10 cards. Some give 14 or 15 cards rather than 11 for an ace.\nWhen permanent wild cards are used, they usually correspond to a larger number of cards, such as 15, 20 or even 25. Alternatively, some play that a wild card dealt as an upcard is buried in the pack and replaced by another card. One description with 2\'s as permanent wild cards says that the player receiving a 2 can choose whether to be dealt 2 or 12 cards in total.\nSome avoid dealing hands with very few cards by burying any small card dealt as an upcard - for example if a 2, 3 or 4 is dealt it is buried and replaced. \nSome groups determine the wild card for the hand by exposing the dealer\'s last card rather than the first card. Some determine the wild card by an extra card dealt face up to the dealer, after the number of cards indicated by the dealer\'s initial upcard have been dealt. \nIf the indicator card is a permanent wild card, some give the dealer additional cards until a card that is not a permanent wild card is found. Others bury the permanent wild card in the deck and deal a replacement indicator card.\nIn one description the wild card for the hand is determined by a separate card dealt after the dealer\'s hand is complete: this indicator card is not used in the game: it does not belong to the dealer, nor is it part of the discard pile.\nRules of Play\nThe play mechanism is essentially similar to that of 500 Rummy, and all the variants of 500 Rummy play can in principle be used in this game as well. \nSome groups have restrictions on the use of wild cards in melds. Some play that the number of natural cards in a meld must always be greater than the number of wild cards. Some play that only one wild card is allowed in a meld, but that a meld of six cards or more can be split into two parts, so that one wild card can be used in each. When playing with these restrictions, players need to agree to how to treat wild cards that represent themselves: for example if sixes are wild, some treat the run 6-7-8 as already containing a wild card, while other groups treat the six as natural since it is the correct value and suit to fit into the run, even though it keeps its "wild" value of 100 points.\nSome players recognise a set of three or more wild cards as a special kind of combination, which can be extended only by adding further wild cards.\nSome allow the real card that a wild card represents in a meld to be traded for the wild card. That is, during the melding part of on\'s turn, one can play the card that corresponds to a wild card on the table, take that wild card and meld it elsewhere or add it to one\'s hand.\nSome require a player who takes more than one card from the discard pile to meld the deepest buried card along with two natural cards from the player\'s hand.\nSome always require the card taken from the discard pile to be melded, even when only the top card is taken.\nMany groups play that a player cannot \'lay off\' cards, adding them to other players\' melds on the table, until after they have melded at least one set or run of their own. Having melded a set or run, a player can then lay off single cards in the same or subsequent turns.\nSome do not allow players to call \'rummy\' when a playable card is discarded. \nOne the other hand, some allow a player to call \'rummy\' when any meld can be made or added to using cards anywhere in the discard pile. This is known as \'rummy in the pile\'. The calling player must take all the cards above the deepest card in the pile that is being melded. This rule is not recommended.\nIn the variant known by some as  George and by others as 2500 Rummy, no runs can be melded, only sets of equal cards. A set can contain at most one wild card, and cards can only be taken from the discard pile when a player has two natural cards in hand that match the deepest buried card that is taken. This version is usually played with a double 48-card pack without twos, and a player\'s first card indicates the total number of cards to be dealt to the player, counting jack as 11, queen 12, king 13, ace 14 or 15.\nEnding the Play and Scoring\nSome allow a player to go out by melding all his or her cards, leaving no card to discard.\nSome play that if a player goes out while one or more other players are floating, the floating player(s) must draw one card from the stock.\nSome play that if a player goes out on his or her first turn to play, any other players who have not yet played take one turn before the hand is scored. If another player also goes out, any bonus for going out is given to the first player who did so.\nWhen scoring, some play that instead of giving unmelded cards to the winner to score, each player subtracts the value of the cards remaining in his or her hand from the amount scored for melded cards. In this version scores will be lower and a player can have a negative score. With this type of scoring some add a bonus of, for example, 200 points to the score of the player who went out.\nThe game ends when a player reaches or exceeds the target score, which may be set at 1500, 2000, 2200, 2500, 2800, 5000 or even 10000. Clearly a higher target leads to a longer game, but the game length is also strongly affected by the card values. Games with permanent wild cards are higher scoring so a higher target is appropriate. Also, games in which unmelded cards are given to the player who goes out are higher scoring and a higher target is appropriate than for a game in which unmelded cards are deducted from the owner\'s score, especially if there is no bonus for going out.\nSome play that if more than one player reaches the target in the same deal, the winner of the game is not the player with the highest score, but the player who went out on that final deal, provided that that player has reached the target. If the player who went out is below the target, then the  highest score among the players who have reached the target wins, and if there is a tie for highest score the tying players are joint winners.\nOther Web Sites\nThis game, although evidently quite popular in North America, is surprisingly little documented: so far as I have noticed it is not described in any of the standard card game books.\nHere are archive copies of Jim Davidson\'s former web pages on  5000 Rummy and 10,000 Rummy.\nAnother description of 5000 Rummy can be found on the Thirtysomething Gamers site.\nThe variant known as George, without runs, appeared in the Anyone for Cards package for Windows 3.1, published in 1993.\nContributors\nI would like to thank the many people, some of them wholly or partly anonymous, who have sent me descriptions of versions of this game.

The game first appeared at the end of the nineteenth century and is now popular in various forms in many countries. This page describes the American version first: the same game is played in Australia under the name Rickety Kate. Some remarks on other variations will be found at the end. \n\nThis page is partly based on information collected by John Hay in preparation for his projected book. Many thanks to John for permission to use it here.\n\nThe Complete Win at Heartsby Joe AndrewsThe classic guide to Hearts strategy.\nPlayers and Cards\nObject of the Game\nDeal and Passing\nPlay of the Hand\nScoring\nVariations\n\nKitty\nPassing\nPlay of the Hand\nScoring\nPartnership Hearts\nOther numbers of players\n\nTurbo Hearts\nBooster Nines\nCancellation Hearts\nSpot Hearts\nBlack Maria\nDa Nasty Fix (Dirty Nasty Filthy Hearts)\nHearts Web Sites and Books\nHearts Software\nOnline Hearts Games\n\nPlayers and Cards\n\nHearts is most commonly played by 4 people. There are no formal partnerships, though there are times when players will find it in their interest to help each other.\n\nA standard 52 card deck is used, with the cards in each suit ranking as usual from ace (high) down to two (low). There is no trump suit.\n\nEach heart is worth one penalty point and the queen of spades is worth 13 penalty points. The other cards have no value.\n\nObject of Game\n\nThe object is to avoid scoring points. The game is ended by someone reaching or going over 100 points, and the winner is the player with the lowest score at this point.\n\nDeal and Passing\n\nDeal and play are clockwise. All the cards are dealt out one at a time, so that everyone has 13.\n\nOn the first hand, after the deal, each player passes any three cards face-down to the player to their left. When passing cards, you must first select the cards to be passed and place them face-down, ready to be picked up by the receiving player; only then may you pick up the cards passed to you, look at them and add them to your hand.\n\nOn the second hand each player passes three cards to the player to their right, in the same way. On the third hand each player passes three cards to the player sitting opposite. On the fourth hand no cards are passed at all. The cycle then repeats until the end of the game.\n\nThe Play of the Hand\n\nThe person who holds the 2 of clubs must lead it to the first trick. The other players, in clockwise order, must play a card of the suit which was led if possible.  If they do not have a card of that suit, they may play any card.  The person who played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick and leads to the next trick.\n\nIt is illegal to lead a heart until after a heart has been played to a previous trick, unless your hand contains nothing but hearts. Discarding a heart, thus allowing hearts to be led in future, is called breaking hearts. In general, discarding a penalty card on a trick is called painting the trick.\n\nA player whose hand consists entirely of hearts may lead any heart, thereby breaking hearts, even if hearts have not previously been broken.\n\nPlayers are permitted to lead spades to any trick after the first. In fact it is a normal tactic to lead lower spades to try to drive out the queen. This is sometimes known as smoking out the queen.\n\nScoring\n\nNormally, each player scores penalty points for cards in the tricks which they won. Each heart scores one point, and the queen of spades scores 13 points. However, if you manage to win all the scoring cards (which is known as a slam or shooting the moon), your score is reduced by 26 points, or you may choose instead to have all other players\' scores increased by 26 points.\n\nThe game continues until one player has reached or exceeded 100 points at the conclusion of a hand.  The person with the lowest score is then the winner.\n\nVariations\nKitty\nSome play that only 12 cards are dealt to each player. During the deal, four cards are dealt to a face down kitty, which is added to the tricks of the first player who takes a penalty card. A kitty can also be used to cope with the fact that the cards cannot be dealt evenly when there are more or fewer than four players.\nPassing\n\nDifferent passing cycles may be used, for example:\n\npass left, pass right, pass across, then repeat (no hold hand);\nscatter instead of hold (players pass one card to every other player);\nboth scatter and hold hands are played (the cycle is left, right, across, scatter, then hold).\nAnother passing method that can be included in the cycle is "mix": everyone discards three cards to a pile in the centre, which is shuffled and then redealt to the players. If you play with a kitty, this can be shuffled in too, so that the new kitty can contain some of the discards.\n\nSome play that players are not required to pass any cards if they do not wish to.  They simply pass on the cards that were passed to them without looking at them.  This could result in a player getting their own cards back. \nPlay of the Hand\n\nSome players allow hearts to be led at any time. This was the original rule, but in the USA nearly everyone now plays that heart leads are forbidden unless hearts have been broken.\n\nThe original rule was that player to the left of the dealer always leads to the first trick (rather than the holder of the 2 of clubs leading it), and may lead any card. Some people still play that way. If you play with the now usual restriction on leading hearts then the opening lead can be anything but a heart.\n\nSome play that is illegal to play points on the very first trick, unless of course you have you have nothing but penalty cards in your hand.\n\nSome play that the Queen of Spades breaks hearts. In other words, hearts may be led anytime after the Queen of Spades or any heart has been played.\n\nIf hearts have not been played and a player is on lead holding nothing but hearts and the Queen of Spades, many people allow hearts to be led, instead of forcing the player to lead the Queen of Spades.\n\nSome players insist that you must play the Queen of Spades as soon as it is safe to do so. This could be when you are void in the suit led or to a spade trick when the Ace or King of Spades has already been played.\n\nScoring\n\nMany people play that the Jack of Diamonds (or sometimes the Ten of Diamonds) is a bonus card, counting minus 10 points for the person taking it. With this form of scoring, the game is known as Omnibus Hearts. To shoot the moon, you need all the hearts and the Q, and as usual you can choose to have 26 points deducted from your score or added to everyone else\'s; in addition to this, 10 points are deducted from the score of the player who took the Jack of Diamonds (who may be the same player as the shooter).\n\nShooting the sun is taking all the tricks (as opposed to taking all points). Some score this as 52 points with the scoring handled in the same as shooting the moon.\n\nThere are variations on the choice of scores for shooting the moon. Possibilities are:\n\nthe shooter always has 26 points deducted;\nall the other players always have 26 points added;\nall the other players always have 26 points added unless this would cause one of them to win, in which case the shooter has 26 points deducted.\n\n\nFor some people, reaching certain scores has a special effect. For example if your score is exactly 100 points at the end of a hand, it is reduced to 50 (or zero).\n\nIf a player reaches or exceeds 100 points and there is a tie for low score, additional hands may be played until there is a clear winner.\n\nPartnership Hearts\n\nThere are two ways that four players can play hearts in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other.\n\nPartners keep their tricks together. On each hand your team scores the total number of penalty points you have taken in your tricks. A slam occurs if one team takes all 14 penalty cards in a hand, they can choose give the opponents 26 penalty points or to subtract 26 penalty points from their own score.\nEach player keeps an individual score, and in order to "shoot the moon", an individual player has to win all the penalty cards. The game continues until an individual player\'s score reaches 100 or more; then the scores of the partners are totalled and the partnership with fewer points wins. Thus it is possible for your team to win even if it is you who go over 100. For example you have 105, your partner has 34, and your opponents have 78 and 69, then your team wins by 139 points to 147.\n\nOther Numbers of Players\n\nThe game may be played with either three or five players.  There are various ways of coping with the fact that the cards cannot all be dealt out equally to the players:\n\nDeal 17 cards each to three players or 10 each to five players.  The one or two remaining cards are called the kitty; they are placed in the middle of the table face down. The kitty cards should be dealt in the middle of the deal, not as the last card(s) - the last card should belong to the dealer, so that no damage is done if the dealer accidentally sees it while dealing. The player who takes the first trick (or alternatively, the first penalty point) takes the kitty and places the card(s) with his or her captured cards (the player may look at them first). If it happens that the 2 is in the kitty, the holder of the lowest club not in the kitty must lead it (if no one has the 2, ask if anyone has the 3, then the 4, and so on).\nAs in method 1 above, but the person who takes the first point or trick adds the kitty to their hand and discards an equal number of cards face down into their tricks.\nWith three players, remove the 2 from the deck, leaving 51 cards. With five players also remove the 2, and the holder of the 3 leads it to the first trick.\n\nIn the 3 player game, the passing may follow any one of these patterns:\n\nLeft, right, hold, repeat.\nLeft, right, repeat.\nIf you pass 4 cards instead of 3 you can also scatter by passing 2 cards to each other player.  You could then include scattering in either of the above rotations.\n\nIn the 5 player game, the passing could follow any of these patterns:\n\nLeft, right, hold, repeat.\nLeft, right, repeat.\nLeft, right, 2nd person to the left, 2nd person to the right, hold, repeat.\nLeft, right, 2nd to the left, hold, left, right, 2nd to the right, hold, repeat.\n\nTwo players can play Huse Hearts for Two, an interesting version involving a dummy hand.\nTurbo Hearts\n\nTurbo Hearts, introduced at Upenn in the 1980\'s by Richard Garfield, is an American version of the Chinese game Gong Zhu (Catch the Pig).\n\nThe Jack of Diamonds is used as in the variations above.\nWhoever captures the Ten of Clubs doubles their score for that hand.\nAfter the pass but before the first lead each player may "turbo-charge" one of the following cards:  Ace of Hearts, Queen of Spades, Jack of Diamonds, or Ten of Clubs.  They do this by placing the card face up in front of them.\nA turbo-charged Queen of Spades or Jack of Diamonds doubles the value of that card for that hand.\nA turbo-charged Ace of Hearts doubles the value of all hearts for that hand.\nA turbo-charged Ten of Clubs quadruples the score for that hand of the player who captures it.\nA player may not play a turbo-charged card the first time a card of that suit is led.\n\nBooster Nines\n\nRichard Garfield recommends the following variation, introduced around 1990. Booster nines work the following way. If a nine is led to a trick or played while following suit, then there is a boost: one more round is played in the same suit - i.e. a further card from each player, in rotation. The suit of the first of the eight cards played is the led suit, and the highest card of this suit takes the eight card trick. If a nine is sloughed (discarded on a lead of a different suit) or played in the last trick, there is no boost - the trick consists of just four cards as usual.\n\nThis variation makes shooting the moon somewhat easier, since you can dump a loser on your own good nine (or one drawn from an opponent).\n\nCancellation Hearts\n\nThis is a version of Hearts for 6 to 10 players using two 52 card packs shuffled together. The cards are dealt out as far as they will go, any left over cards being placed in a face-down kitty which is taken by the winner of the first trick. The player to the dealer\'s left leads first and can lead anything.\n\nWhen two identical cards are played to a trick, they cancel each other out in terms of trick-taking power (but still carry penalty points if they are penalty cards). The trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led which is not duplicated. If all the cards played of the suit led are in cancelling pairs, the trick remains on the table, the same player leads again, and the cards go to the winner of the next trick. If the very last trick has no winner its cards go to the winner of the previous trick.\n\nSpot Hearts\n\nThis is a variation in which the penalty value of the hearts is their pip-value. That is, the two the 2 penalty points, the three 3, the four 4, etc. The jack of hearts carries 11 penalty points, queen 12, king 13, ace 14, and the queen of spades 25.\n\nAs an alternative, some play that hearts from 2-10 are face value, all heart pictures are 10, the heart ace is 15, and the spade queen is 25.\n\nPlaying spot hearts the scores are higher, so a higher target score is needed - say 500.\n\nBlack Maria\n\nThis is the British version of Hearts, sometimes also called Dirty Lady, Slippery Bitch.\n\nNB. There is also an entirely different Finnish game called Black Maria (Mustamaija in Finnish; Svarta Maija in Swedish). A description of that game will be found on the Mustamaija page.\n\nIn Black Maria there are usually 3 players; the 2 of clubs is removed from the pack and 17 cards are dealt to each player. Black Maria can also be played by four people, in which case all the cards are dealt out.\n\nCards always passed in same direction - the books say pass three to the right, but some players pass three to the left.\n\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads first and may lead anything. There is no restriction on leading hearts.\n\nThere are various alternative scoring schemes:\n\n1 for each heart; 13 for the queen of spades (as in the USA)\n1 for each heart; 13 for the queen of spades; 10 for the king of spades; 7 for the ace of spades (total 43 points)\nas in Spot Hearts: 2 - 10 of hearts face value; J, Q, K of hearts 10 points; ace of hearts 15 points; queen of spades 25 points. In this case the game is played to 500 points, not 100.\n\nDirty Nasty Filthy Hearts (Da Nasty Fix)\n\nShiva Ctylyctyc describes a Hearts variation from Florida.\n\nThe diamond Jack counts as minus 10 (it is known as "The Lil Man" or "The Cake Daddy"). Caking is a term used to describe the act of showering someone with money, gifts, etc, for nothing in return.\nThe penalty for the Queen of Spades ("The Queen Bitch") is 26 points, and the other three Queens cost 13 points apiece.\nBecause of the larger number of penalty points in play, the game is played to 300 points. When someone reaches or goes over 300, the player with the lowest score wins.\nIf you successfully shoot - that is, take all the counting cards cards in your tricks - you win the game, and the person to your left must vacate their seat for the next player, if any, waiting to join the game.\nNo points may be thrown on the first trick ("The Calm"). As a variation, some people play "Wide Open" which, means that anything can be thrown on the first trick.\nThe deuce of clubs starts - the holder leads it to the first trick.\nAfter the cut, but before the start of the deal, the dealer "calls pass", that is, specifies how cards will be passed for that hand. The dealer may choose any variant (for example: two to the left, one to the right), as long as each player passes and receives three cards and the method is the same for all four players. An extra option is a special pass called "Shittin\' in the Kitty" - everyone passes to the middle, and those 12 cards are shuffled and dealt by the dealer.\nThrowing hearts is called "painting", running the spades suit is\n"Beating for the Bitch" (as in "beating the bush for ..."). The Queens of Clubs and Hearts are called "The Weak Bitches" because the Q is in the\nmain throwoff suit, and the Q is in the paint suit.\n\nLow cards are called "duckers" and it is a habit of players to yell "That ain\'t no duckah!" just before they paint your lead, especially if your lead should have been a ducker, but you messed up in counting.\n\n\nVarious tactical nuances now exist, for example:\n\nYou now need the queen of each suit in order to shoot.\nSince you can win by shooting, it is still in no-one\'s interest to help you (unless they wish to get rid of the person to your left from the game).\nHow to get the Jack of Diamonds without getting the Queen of Diamonds (which is called the "Rich Bitch" or "Money Bitch"; some people call it the "Thief Bitch" because it can steal your minus 10 for the jack and leave you with plus 3 instead.\nA certain amount of diplomacy comes into play, in persuading people not to help the person to your right to shoot you.  They might be tempted to do this to remove you from the game if you win a lot or get obnoxious.\nThis form of hearts is quite easily converted to a vicious drinking game.\n\nOther web sites and books about Hearts\n\nHere are some other WWW pages with rules for Hearts and its variations:\n\nJohn Hay\'s Hearts page, from which quite a lot of the above information was taken.\nAlan Hoyle\'s Hearts Page for a typical set of rules.\nAlan Hoyle has also provided a copy of the former page on the\nCaltech variant, a more elaborate version.\nCavendish Rules of Hearts are available from Bob Ciaffone\'s web site.\nAlan Gilfoy\'s Hearts page\n\nRickety Kate, the Australian version of Hearts, is practically identical to American Hearts.

Face up spades do not count, so for example if the ace of spades is dealt face up, the king of spades in the hole is sure to win half the pot.\nThe cards are dealt as in seven card stud: two cards face down, four cards face up  and the last card face down. There are five betting rounds: one after each round of face up cards and one after the final card. Each betting round is begun by the player with the highest hand showing.\nAfter the final betting round the active players declare whether they are going for highest (face down) spade, highest hand or both. A player declaring both wins only if holding both the highest spade and the highest hand. Declaration can be either in sequence, starting to the left of the dealer, or simultaneous, using chips.\nYou must have a spade face down to be eligible to win the spade half of the pot. Without this, you cannot declare spade and win, even if all the other players are going for high.\nVariants\nIn Low Chicago the pot is split between the lowest spade (ace counting high) and the highest hand (it is not a low poker game). Similar games can of course be played using any suit: for example in High or Low San Francisco the high hand splits the pot with the highest or lowest heart.\nFollow the Queen\nThis is seven card stud in which when a queen is dealt face up, the next card dealt face up and the other three cards of the same rank become wild for all players. For example a player gets the Q face up and the next player is dealt the 7 face up: all sevens are now wild. If another queen is dealt face up, the previous wild card is cancelled, and the face up card following the new queen becomes wild instead. If the last face up card dealt is a queen, there are no wild cards. In the showdown the highest hand wins.\nVariants\nSome play that all queens in the hole are wild. In this version there can be as many as seven wild cards in play: three concealed queens and four wild cards created by an exposed queen.\nSome play that if no queens are dealt face up, no one wins and there is a new deal, played for the same pot, involving only the players who did not fold on the deal without a face up queen.\nSome play that if the last card dealt face up is a queen., the dealer deals one further card face up. This card belongs to no one, but the other three cards of the same rank are wild.\nDirty Schultz\nThis is similar to Follow the Queen, except that the event that causes the next card to become wild is the appearance of a natural pair among any player\'s face up cards.\nSo whenever a card is dealt face up that is the same rank as another face up card held by that player, the next card that is dealt becomes wild (as do all cards that are equal to it), and the previous wild card (if any) ceases to be wild.  If the very last face up card that is dealt creates a pair, then there nothing at all is wild.\nTwo details need to be clarified before playing this variant:\n\nWhat happens if a player who has a wild card face up is dealt a second (equal) wild card face up? My suggestion: these cards are equal so they count as a pair, and the next card dealt will change the wild card.\nWhat happens if a player who already has a natural pair is dealt a third equal card face up? My suggestion: this is not a new pair, so the wild card does not change. However, if a player has 5, 8 face up and 5\'s are currently wild, and the player is then dealt a second 8 face up, this pair of 8\'s is a new natural pair, and the next card dealt changes the wild card.\n\nVariants\nSome play that after a pair is dealt, the next card is immediately dealt face up to the centre of the table. This centre card belongs to no one, but all cards of the same rank as it are wild. Whenever a new pair appears, another card is dealt to the centre on top of the previous one, and this will normally change the wild card. In this version, a wild card is dealt to the centre even if the very last card dealt face up to a player is wild - so there will always be a wild card if any player has a pair showing.\nSome play that each player\'s seventh card is dealt face up, unless the player pays a  fixed price to the pot to have the seventh card dealt face down. By buying a face down card at the end you avoid the risk of changing the wild card if it pairs one of your face up cards, and also gain the advantage of having three rather than two cards concealed from the other players.\nThe Bitch\nThe Bitch in this seven card stud variant is the queen of spades. If the queen of spades is dealt face up, the deal and betting immediately stop, all the cards are thrown in and shuffled, and there is a new deal involving only those players who had not folded when the queen of spades appeared.\nIn the showdown the player with the highest hand splits the pot with the player who has the queen of spades in the hole (if any). If the queen of spades was not dealt at all the high hand wins the whole pot.\nVariants\nSome play that the queen of spades in the hole is wild. In this case the pot is not split. \nBlack Mariah\nThis name is used for at least four different variants.\n\nOften, Black Mariah is used as an alternative name for The Bitch.\nSome play Black Mariah as a variant of Follow the Queen in which if the Q is dealt face up, the play immediately ends, as in The Bitch.\nSome play Black Mariah as a seven card stud variant in which you must have the best hand and the highest spade to win the pot. The high spade can be any of your seven cards, not necessarily face down. If the best hand and the highest spade in the showdown are held by different players, or if no one has any spades, no one wins and the pot remains for the new deal, in which only the players who were in the showdown take part.\nSometimes Black Mariah is used as an alternative name for High Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Chicago\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2010, 2011.

From a standard 52 card pack remove one queen leaving 51 cards. It is also possible to play with a special pack - see variations below. Deal and play are clockwise. \nPlay\n\nThe dealer deals out all the cards to the players (generally some will have one more card than others - this does not matter). The players all look at their cards and discard any pairs they have (a pair is two cards of equal rank, such as two sevens or two kings).\n\nThe dealer begins. At your turn you must offer your cards spread face down to the player to your left. That player selects a card from your hand without seeing it, and adds it to her hand. If it makes a pair in her hand she discards the pair. The player who just took a card then offers her hand to the next player to her left, and so on.\n\n\nIf you get rid of all your cards you are safe and you take no further part. The turn passes to the next player to your left, who spreads his or her cards for the following player to draw one.   Eventually all the cards will have been discarded except one queen (the old maid) and the holder of this queen loses.\n\nVariations\nIn some countries, where the game has a male name, such as Black Peter, it is a Jack that is removed rather than a Queen, and the loser is the holder of the odd Jack at the end.\nIt is also possible to play a reversed version of Old Maid. The mechanism of the game is exactly the same, but when everyone else has run out of cards the holder of the odd card (the last Queen or Jack or the Old Maid card) is the winner.\n\n  Old Maid is sometimes played with a special pack of cards: all the cards come in matching pairs except for a single Old Maid card, whose holder at the end is the loser. Some German sets of Quartett cards come with a Black Peter card so that they can also be used for this game. Several types of Old Maid cards can be obtained from funagain.com or amazon.com, individually or in collections of childrens\' games.\n\n\nClassic Card Games\n\n\n\nPairs of animalsbuzzard for old maid\n\n\n\nMelissa & Doug Classic Card Game Set\n\n\n\n4 Children\'s Card Games\n\n\nSchwarzer Peter\nThe equivalent game to Old Maid in Germany and several other European countries is called \'Black Peter\'. Originally it was played with a standard pack (often a 32-card pack) from which  a black jack  was removed. The final holder of the odd jack when all other cards had been paired was the loser. However,  it is more often played with a special pack of 31 or 37 cards in which the Schwarzer Peter card depicts a black cat or a chimney sweep. Before the game, one end of a (real) cork is carefully blackened by holding it over a candle flame. This is used to draw a black mark on the loser\'s face. Sometimes a Schwarzer Peter card is included with a pack of Quartet cards, so that the deck can be used for either game.\nOther websites and software\nThe collection \n  HOYLE Card Games for Windows or Mac OS X  includes an Old Maid program, along with many other popular card games.\nThe Card Game Heaven site has a page of rules for Old Maid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Card Passing Games > Old Maid\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1996, 2008, 2015.

It is a banking game in which the aim of the player is to achieve a hand whose points total nearer to 21 than the banker\'s hand, but without exceeding 21.\nIn Nevada casinos the game is generally known 21 rather than Blackjack, and the holding of an ace with a 10-point card is called a "natural".\nConfusingly, the name Black Jack is used in Britain for an entirely different card game which is essentially the same as Crazy Eights.\n\nThe following outline explains the basic rules of standard blackjack (21), along with the house rules most commonly featured in casinos. Players should bear in mind, though, that blackjack rules vary from casino to casino, and check for local variations before playing.\nEquipment\nBlackjack is played with an international 52-card deck without jokers. Casinos normally use several decks mixed together (called a shoe), both in order to speed up the game (with more cards in play you don\'t have to reshuffle after every single hand) and to make card counting more difficult (card counting is a technique used to gain an advantage over the casino by keeping track of the proportions of different value cards remaining in play.)\nThe number of decks differs from casino to casino, but there can be anything from two to eight decks in the shoe. The re-shuffling frequency also differs from casino to casino, and of course depends on the number of decks used. Frequent re-shuffling is another way to diminish the value of card counting.\nIn casinos, blackjack is played on a specially designed table. There is a permanent dealer employed by the casino, and room for up to eight simultaneous players, playing against the dealer. Each player has a designated playing area in front of him where cards are placed and bets are made.\nThe betting limits should be clearly posted on a sign on the blackjack table. Normally, some of the most important rules, such as "Blackjack pays 3 to 2" and "Dealer must draw on 16 and stand on all 17\'s" are printed on the table.\nTo play blackjack you need chips to bet with, and you typically buy your chips directly from the dealer. When there is a break in the action, you simply put cash on the table and the dealer will change it for an equal value of playing chips.\nThe standard denominations for casino chips are: \n\nwhite chips = $1\nred chips = $5\ngreen chips = $25\nblack chips = $100 \n\nHome game blackjack\nWhen you play blackjack at home, you should take turns being the dealer, to ensure fairness in the game (unless the player who is hosting the game specifically has stated that he or she wants to act as the house the entire game and the other players agree to this.)\nYou can switch dealer every hand, every five hands or whatever you decide. If you\'re playing with a single deck of cards, the best idea is to re-shuffle after every hand. Of course, you don\'t need a fancy blackjack table to play the game, but you will need at least one pack of cards and something to bet with - cash, chips or maybe matches.\nBetting and winning\nEach player at the blackjack table has a circle or box to place bets in. There will always be a minimum bet and a maximum bet for the table. The maximum bet is normally ten to twenty times the minimum bet, meaning that a table with a $5 minimum would have a $50 to $100 maximum. Each player decides how much to bet on a hand before the deal.\nEach hand will result in one of the following events for the player:\n\nLose - the player\'s bet is taken by the dealer.\nWin - the player wins as much as he bet. If you bet $10, you win $10 from the dealer (plus you keep your original bet, of course.)\nBlackjack (natural) - the player wins 1.5 times the bet. With a bet of $10, you keep your $10 and win a further $15 from the dealer.\nPush - the hand is a draw. The player keeps his bet, neither winning nor losing money.\n\nGame objective\nAlthough many players may play in a single round of blackjack, it\'s fundamentally a two-player game. In blackjack, players don\'t play against each other; and they don\'t co-operate. The only competition is the dealer.\nThe aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21. You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards.\nThe cards 2 through 10 have their face value, J, Q, and K are worth 10 points each, and the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (player\'s choice). \nThe deal and "blackjack"\nAt the start of a blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each. The players\' cards are normally dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down (called the hole card) and one face up.\nThe best possible blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card. This is called a "blackjack", or a natural 21, and the player holding this automatically wins unless the dealer also has a blackjack. If a player and the dealer each have a blackjack, the result is a push for that player. If the dealer has a blackjack, all players not holding a blackjack lose.\nThe players\' turns\nAfter the cards have been dealt, the game goes on with each player taking action - in clockwise order starting to dealer\'s left.\nFirst, the player must declare if he wants to take advantage of the side rules (explained below). You can only use the side rules once, when it\'s your turn to act after the deal. \nThen the player can keep his hand as it is (stand) or take more cards from the deck (hit), one at a time, until either the player judges that the hand is strong enough to go up against the dealer\'s hand and stands, or until it goes over 21, in which case the player immediately loses (busts).\nIn most places, players can take as many cards as they like, as long as they don\'t bust, but some casinos have restrictions regarding this.\nThe dealer\'s turn\nWhen all players have finished their actions, either decided to stand or busted, the dealer turns over his hidden hole card.\nIf the dealer has a natural 21 (blackjack) with his two cards, he won\'t take any more cards. All players lose, except players who also have a blackjack, in which case it is a push - the bet is returned to the player.\nIf the dealer doesn\'t have a natural, he hits (takes more cards) or stands depending on the value of the hand. Contrary to the player, though, the dealer\'s action is completely dictated by the rules. The dealer must hit if the value of the hand is lower than 17, otherwise the dealer will stand. \nWhether or not the dealer must hit on a soft 17 (a hand of 17 containing an ace being counted as 11) differs from casino to casino. There might even be blackjack tables with different rules within the same casino.\nShowdown\nIf the dealer goes bust, all players who are left in the game win. Otherwise players with higher point totals than the dealer win, while players with lower totals than the dealer lose. For those with the same total as the dealer the result is a push: their stake is returned to them and they neither win nor lose.\nPlayers with a blackjack win a bet plus a bonus amount, which is normally equal to half their original wager. A blackjack hand beats any other hand, also those with a total value of 21 but with more cards.\nAs described above, if the dealer has a blackjack, players with blackjack make a push, while all other players lose.\nBlackjack Side Rules\nAbove, the basic rules of blackjack are described. In addition, numerous side rules allow for more intricate betting strategies. These side rules can only be used immediately after the deal, before you take any more cards. You cannot, for example, take a third card and then decide to double down.\nThe most widely practiced options are explained below:\nInsurance\nWhen the dealer\'s face-up card is an ace, each player gets the chance to bet on whether the dealer has a blackjack or not. This is done before any other player actions.\nThe insurance wager equals your original bet and is used to cancel out the likely loss of this bet. A winning insurance bet will be paid at odds of 2:1, and since you lose your original bet, you\'ll break even on the hand. Strategy guides tend to advice against taking insurance.\nSurrender\nIf you have a bad hand compared to the dealer\'s hand (judging from what you can see of it,) you can give up the hand and reclaim half your bet. The casino keeps the other half uncontested. You need a really bad hand match-up for a surrender to be profitable, such as 16 vs the dealer showing a 10.\nAt some casinos, surrenders will not be allowed if the dealer has a blackjack (which he then checks for immediately after the deal). If the dealer has a blackjack, no surrenders will be granted and you\'ll lose the entire bet - unless you also have a blackjack, in which case it\'s a push. This side rule variation is called late surrender.\nSplitting\nWhen you get two starting cards of the same face value, you have the option to split the hand in two. You place another bet of the same size as the original bet and play on with two hands. (Note that it is legal to split 10-point cards even if they do not form a pair - for example you could split a jack and a king.)\nWhen you\'ve decided to split a hand, the dealer immediately deals a second card to each hand. Now, if you\'re dealt yet another pair, some casinos allow you to split the hand again, while others don\'t.\nWhen you\'re done splitting, each of your hands will be treated separately, meaning that you will take cards to your first hand until you stand or bust, and then carry on with the next hand.\nIf you split aces, you are dealt a second card to each hand as usual, but you are not allowed to take any further cards (unless you are dealt another ace and split again). All hands resulting from splitting aces remain as two-card hands.\nIf the second card dealt to a split ace is a 10-point card you do not receive the blackjack bonus for this hand. It does however win against an ordinary 21 made of more than two cards. If the dealer also has a blackjack the result for this hand is a push as usual. In many places the same rule (no blackjack bonus) is played if an ace is dealt as the second card to a 10-point card after splitting.\nDoubling Down\nIf you\'re fairly sure that your hand will beat the dealer\'s, you can double your original bet. You\'re sometimes allowed to double down for any amount up to the original bet amount. In most casinos you may double down on any hand, but some casinos require an opening hand worth 11, 10 or 9.\nWhen you\'ve chosen to double down, you\'ll only get one more card from the dealer.\nSwedish Pub Blackjack\n Nightclubs and pubs in Sweden often offer Blackjack variant that is less  favourable to the players. All the essential rules are the same as in the casino version unless there is except for this:  what happens  when the player and dealer have an equal total of 17, 18 or 19. In the  casino version the player\'s stake is returned in these situations , but in Swedish pubs the  house wins. \nAlthough  pub stakes may vary, they are often much lower than in casinos with a minimum stake of  20 or 40 Krona and a maximum of 60 Krona (about US$7) for each hand.\nSites for blackjack rules, information and analysis\n\nHere are some links for rules and information about Blackjack (21).\n\nThe Blackjack FAQ and the associated newsgroups rec.gambling.blackjack.moderated and rec.gambling.blackjack\nThe Lucky Blackjack site has information on Blackjack rules and variants, advice on tactics, links to online casinos where Blackjack can be played, and other Blackjack resources.\nKenneth R Smith\'s blackjackinfo.com site, where you can use the Blackjack Basic Strategy Engine to check the best basic strategy under various casino rules, and where you can also find a complete explanation of the rules of casino blackjack.\nNorman Wattenberger\'s Blackjack in Color is an unusual free Web-based Blackjack book providing an analysis of  Blackjack and Card Counting illustrated by 139 charts.

Club of America. I have added some common variations.\n\nIntroduction\nPlayers and CardsSequence of Hands\nObject of the Game\nDeal\nBidding\nPlay\nScoring\nVariations\nRelated Games\nOther Oh Hell WWW Pages\n\nSoftware, Online Games, Score Sheets and Scoring Applications\n\nIntroduction\nThis game, in which players try to predict the exact number of tricks they will win, first appeared in London and New York in the 1930\'s and has since become popular in many parts of the world. Its original name Oh Hell! evidently offended some people and has been bowdlerised in many books to Oh Pshaw! or Oh Well!, while others  have preferred more robust alternatives such as Oh Shit! Some call it Blob or Blackout, perhaps because of the practice of recording a player\'s bid on the scoresheet and then obliterating it with a black blob if the player failed to take the predicted number of tricks. Traditionally the size of the players\' hands increases or decreases by one in each deal, and this has given rise to the names Elevator (l\'Ascenseur in France), Up and Down the River (in Australia and New Zealand) and 10 op en neer in the Netherlands. In Britain it is often known as Nomination Whist, a name which also sometimes refers to different games. Other names include Bust (in Australia and New Zealand), Boerenbridge (in the Netherlands), Kachuful (in India) and German Bridge (in Hong Kong).\nPlayers and Cards\n\nFrom 3 to 7 people can play. The game is best when played with 4 to 6.\n\n\n\n  A standard 52 card deck is used. The cards in each suit rank (from high to low) A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.\n  \nSequence of Hands\n\nThe game consists of a series of hands. The first hand is played with 7 to 10 cards dealt to each player, depending on the number of players:\n\n3 to 5 players, 10 cards each;\n6 players, 8 cards each;\n7 players, 7 cards each\n\n(because of the limit of 52 cards available). Each successive hand is played with one card fewer, down to a hand of just one card each, then one card more per hand back up to the starting level. \n\nExample: With 7 players, the hands are: 7 cards, then 6,5,4,3,2,1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7, for a total of 13 hands to the game. A game should take approximately 45 minutes.\n\nObject of the Game\n\nThe object is for each player to bid the number of tricks he thinks he can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many; no more and no fewer. Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly, and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or under (see scoring below).\n\nThe hook is that at least one player will fail on each hand, because the total number of tricks bid by the players may not equal the number of tricks available on that hand.\n\nDeal\n\nTo determine the first dealer, draw cards. The player with the highest card deals first. The turn to deal rotates clockwise with each hand.\n\nThe cards are shuffled and cut and the dealer deals the cards singly until everyone has the appropriate number of cards for the hand being played. The next card is turned face up and the suit of this card is the trump suit for the hand. The trump suit beats any of the other three suits played in that hand. The remaining undealt cards are placed in a face down stack with the turned trump on top of it.\n\nBidding\n\nThe bidding in each hand begins with the player to the left of the dealer, then continues clockwise, back around to the dealer, who bids last. Each bid is a number representing the number of tricks that player will try to take. Everyone must bid - it is not possible to pass, but you can bid zero, in which case your object is to take no tricks at all. A bid may be changed only if the next player to the left has not yet bid. Remember the hook: the dealer may not bid the number that would cause the total number of tricks bid to equal the number of tricks available; a hand will always be "over-bid" or "under-bid". Keep in mind when bidding that not all cards in the deck are in play in any hand.\n\nPlay\n\nThe play begins with the player to the dealer\'s left, who leads the first card. The lead may be any suit (including trump). Play follows clockwise. Each player must follow the suit led, if he can. If not, he may play any other card in his hand, including trump. The player who has played the highest trump card, or if no trump was played, the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick. That player then leads to the next trick. Continue until all tricks have been played and won.\n\nScoring\n\nThe scorekeeper is designated prior to each game according to house rules. The scorekeeper, needless to say, has a distinct advantage, and should be monitored closely for "inadvertent" errors. The designated scorekeeper notes each bid and resulting scores on a score sheet. There are many different ways to score Oh Hell!\n\n\nIn the simplest version, a player who wins the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the number of tricks bid (10 points for zero tricks, 11 for 1 trick, 12 for two tricks, etc.) Players who take more or fewer tricks than they bid score nothing. This method has the advantage that the scorekeeper, having written down the bids at the start of the play, can simply write a figure "1" in front of those that were successful and delete those that are not. The game with this scoring method is often known as Blackout or Blob, because the scorer obliterates or blacks out unsuccessful bids, so that they become black blobs on the score sheet. \n\nPerhaps the most widespread scoring method is to award 1 point for each trick won plus a bonus of 10 points for players who win exactly the number of tricks they bid. So for example a player who bid 2 would score 12 points for winning exactly 2 tricks, but only 1 for 1 trick and 3 for 3 tricks. This gives a player whose bid fails a slight incentive to win as many tricks as possible.\n\nSome other scoring methods are given in the variations section below. Whatever method is used, the score keeper keeps a cumulative total of each player\'s score. The final cumulative scores determine the result. If the game is played for money, players pay or receive amounts corresponding to the difference of their scores from the average.\n\n\nSeveral people have produced preprinted Oh Hell score sheets and applications, reflecting various scoring methods. \nVariations\nSequence of Hands\n\nThere are a lot of variations of this. Some people start from 1 card each, go up to the maximum number of cards and then back down to 1. Some just go from the maximum down to 1 and then stop, or vice versa. If there are four people the maximum number of cards dealt may be 13 rather than 10, with three people you can go up to 17. Some people go up to some other maximum, such as 7 cards, irrespective of the number of players.\n\nDan Strohm describes a version, called Devil\'s Bridge, in which the hand size increases and then decreases. On the final 1 card hand, the players must each hold their card on their forehead, so each player can see all the other player\'s cards but not their own.\n\n\nBryce Francis reports that in Australia, when playing Bust with 5 players, they add 13 low cards from a second pack to make a 65 card pack, so as to deal 13 cards each on the first hand as with 4 players. When there are six players they add a further 13 low cards, so that the bottom half of the pack is duplicated. If duplicate cards are played to a trick, the second played beats the first.\n\nA 3-player game is also possible, removing 13 low cards from a single pack.Determining Trumps\n\nSome sequences include hands in which all cards are dealt (for example 13 cards each to 4 players). There is of course then no card left to determine the trump suit. These hands are played without trumps. Some play the largest deals without trumps even if not all the cards are used.\n\nInstead of turning up a card, some people go through the possible trump suits in a fixed sequence. This sequence may or may not include "no trumps".\n\nIn the Indian (Gujurati) game Kachuful, the sequence of trump suits is spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts and the name of the game, which literally means \'raw flower\', is also a mnemonic for this sequence: Ka = Kari = Spades,\nChu = Chukat = Diamonds, \nFu = Falli = Clubs, L = Lal = Hearts\n\n  Brad Wilson describes a version called "Oh Shit!" in which Spades are always trumps.\n\nJean-Pierre Coulon reports a variation in which after the appropriate number of cards have been dealt to the players, the next card is turned face up. If the rank of the turned up card is from 2 to 6, there are no trumps for the deal; if it is 7 or higher, the suit of the turned up card is trumps.\n\nBidding\n\nSome people play without the hook rule, so the dealer is allowed to bid in such a way that everyone can win. There was a lively discussion in rec.games.playing-cards as to which version is more skilful, with strong advocates of each. Some think that hands where the bids add up are too easy; but others say that forcing the bids not to add up removes a tactical option from the dealer.\n\nSome play with simultaneous bidding. When the players are ready to bid, they put a fist on the table.  When everyone\'s fist is out, the group says "One, Two, Three" while bouncing their fists on the table. On Three, everyone must stick out some number of fingers (possibly zero) to indicate how many tricks they will try to take. Of course, with this method, there\'s no restriction against the total number of bid tricks being equal to the number of cards dealt. Since players cannot adjust their bids based on the other players\' bids, the total tricks bid can be wildly different from the tricks available - for example it is not uncommon for three or four players to bid "one" when only one card was dealt. Several correspondents report that in Australia, most groups use simultaneous bidding rather than bidding in turn.\n\nPlay\nSome play that the dealer, rather than the player to dealer\'s left, leads to the first trick.\nDavid Wuori (of Maine, USA) reports a variation in which a player who has no card of the suit led must trump. Only if you have no cards of the suit led and no trumps can you discard from a different non-trump suit. Although this is rule is uncommon in English speaking countries, it is actually the usual way of playing La Podrida (the Spanish equivalent to Oh Hell played in Latin America and in Spain) as well as the equivalent Romanian game of Whist.\nMark Brader suggests a variation in which two jokers are included, to make a 54-card deck. These jokers are a suit of their own containing just two equal cards. If a joker is led it wins the trick unless trumped. If a joker is turned up the other joker is the only trump. \nDick Atkinson reports a version of Blackout for 5 or 6 players, played in Northeast England in the 1970s. Two jokers are added to the pack, and if there are 5 players the four deuces are removed leaving 50 cards. With 5 players the deal is always 10 cards each and with 6 players 9 cards each. The trump suit rotates from deal to deal in the order hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades. The dealer could not make the bid total equal the number of cards dealt. Jokers could not be led (unless the player had no other cards) and could not be played in  the first trick. Apart from that, a joker could be played to any trick (even if the player could have followed suit). The first player of a joker could nominate it as either "high", automatically winning the trick or "low", automatically losing. The player of the second joker had no choice: it would be low if the first joker was high and high if the first was low. If a player was forced to lead a joker, the first suited card played determined the suit of the trick.\nScoring\n\nThere are many alternative systems.\n\nSome players give the usual 10-point bonus for a successful positive bid but award only 5 points for a successful bid of zero. Others award 5 plus the number of cards dealt to each player for a successful zero bid, recognising the fact that zero is more difficult when more cards are dealt.\nSome score 10 points for each trick bid and won for a successful bid. A successful "zero" bid wins 10 points. A player whose bid is unsuccessful (over or under) loses 10 points times the difference between the number of tricks won and the number of tricks bid.\nAnother system is that you win 5 points if you are right plus 10 for each trick taken, and you lose 5 points if you are wrong plus an extra 5 for each trick difference from your bid.\nYet another system: if you make your bid exactly you score 10 points plus the square of the number of tricks you bid (i.e. 10 points for none, 11 for one, 14 for two, 19 for three, 26 for four, etc.); if you fail you lose the square of the difference between the number of tricks you bid and the number of tricks you took.\nSome play for a single winner, who is the player with the highest score when the whole series of hands has been played. In case of a tie after the last hand, some deal further hand(s) with the maximum number of cards until a clear winner is determined. The winner may not be any of those involved in the original tie - any player can win until the end.\n\nMore variations\nThe Oh Hell Variations page in the Invented Games section of this site has a collection of Oh Hell variations contributed by readers.\nA version of Oh Hell! under the Dutch name Boerenbridge was formerly available to play against three computer opponents at  Kaartspellen online (www.useme.nl/kaartspellen). In the variation offered there: \n\n\nThe whole pack is dealt every time - 13 cards each to four players. \nBidding is simultaneous. \nScore 1 point for each trick won, plus a bonus of 10 is you make your bid exactly. \nIf you bid and make zero you score 20 points. \nIf your score is 80 or more you do not take part in the bidding, but just score 1 for each trick you win. \nThe objective is to score exactly 100; if you go over 100 you bounce back - your excess over 100 is subtracted from 100. \n\n\nRelated games\n\nLa Podrida is the equivalent Spanish game to Oh Hell!, played with a 52-card pack. There is also a similar game La Pocha, played with the 40-card Spanish deck. \n\nRomanian Whist is a variation of Oh Hell!, played in Romania with a 32-card pack.\n\n\nDavid Parlett\'s 36-card game Ninety-Nine is based on similar principles, but with an extra twist to the bidding.\n\nGerman Bridge is a version of Oh Hell played in Hong Kong.

In the nineteenth century the game of Dom Pedro became popular in both Ireland and America. In Ireland the name was shortened to Don, and it seems likely that it was from Ireland that it spread to England and Wales.\nThe first version described on this page is Nine-card Don, which is played in Cheshire, Lancashire and South Wales. According to Arthur Taylor\'s "Guiness Book of Traditional Pub Games" (1992) it is also known as Big Don, Long Don, or Welsh Don.\nThe second game is Blind Don, or Two Player Don, which is a version of Nine-Card Don for two players, played in Lancashire.\nThe third version is played mainly in Ireland, and I have therefore called it Irish Don on this page, though in Ireland it is just known as Don. It differs from Nine-card Don in that all the cards are dealt - 13 to each player rather than nine, that the scoring value of the nines is increased, and that there is no score for \'game\'.\nThe fourth game on this page is Phat, which is played in England and Scotland, and is quite similar to Irish Don, but with the \'game\' score as in 9-card Don included. I do not know the origin of the name Phat, which is applied to the high scoring cards as well as the game overall. It is tempting to think that the valuable cards are \'fat\' because they carry many points, but that does not account for the spelling of the name.\nNine Card Don\n\nThis description is based on information from players in the Bolton Don League (Lancashire) and the Abercarn Crib and Don League (South Wales), and reports from other players in both areas: Pontypool, Bridgend and Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales and Preston in Lancashire.\n\nI am told that this game is also extremely popular in Cheshire and former parts of \nCheshire such as Widnes, Stockport and Stalybridge. It is played intensively in the Cheshire Regiment -  now 1st Bn The \n  Mercian Regiment (Cheshire) and  also, to a lesser extent, in the Staffordshire Regiment - now 3rd Bn The Mercian Regiment \n(Staffordshire).\nPlayers and objective\nThere are four players in fixed partnerships; partners sit opposite each other. Deal and play are clockwise. This is a point trick game: each team scores points during the play for winning particular cards in tricks, and also the team which has the greater total value of cards in their tricks, according to a different card value scale, scores extra points. The first team to reach an agreed total (91 or 121) wins the game.\nCards, Ranking and Values\nA standard 52 card pack is used. The cards in each of the four suits rank from high to low A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\nTricks have no value in themselves; the object is to win tricks with certain cards in them. It is important to distinguish between the points that are scored during the play (usually by pegging on a peg board) for winning tricks containing particular trumps or any five, and the card values in all suits that are used to decide which team scores the extra points for \'game\' at the end of the play.\n\n\nPoints scored immediatelyfor cards and game\nAce of trumps4 points\nKing of trumps3 points\nQueen of trumps2 points\nJack of trumps1 point\n9 of trumps9 points\n5 of trumps10 points\nEach non-trump 55 points\nGame8 points\n\nCard values used to decide which teamscores the 8 points for game\n\nEach Ace4 points\nEach King3 points\nEach Queen2 points\nEach Jack1 point\nEach Ten10 points\n\nIf both teams have cards withthe same total value then neither teamscores the points for game\n\nIn South Wales the Fives are generally known as Dons.\nChoice of players, Seating, Deal\nThe cards are cut for first \'pitch\', i.e. the right to lead first (and make trumps) on the first deal. One player from each partnership draws a card and the higher card wins, with Ace counting high. The winner of the cut decides who will lead to the first trick (normally if you win the cut you should give the first pitch to yourself or your partner).\nThe person to the right of the player with the pitch is the first dealer. The dealer shuffles, and offers the cards to the player on his right to cut. The dealer then deals nine cards to each player, one at a time. The remaining 16 cards are set aside face down and are not used in that hand. Subsequently the turn to deal rotates clockwise after each hand. The pitcher is the player to dealer\'s left.\nThe players may look at and sort their hands, except for the player to dealer\'s right - the pitcher\'s partner - who must not touch the cards until after the first card has been led. (This is to prevent any possibility of illegally signalling to the pitcher which suit to make trumps.)\nIn Lancashire, Don is often played in pubs, where there may be more than four people waiting for a game. In this case, a procedure called \'jacks out\' is used to decide which four people will play. Those who wish to take part (5 to 7 people - because if there were 8 you would have two complete tables) each place a stake (typically a pound - maybe 5 pounds) on the table, and the cards are dealt out one at a time, face up to the stakes. When a jack appears, the player who contributed that stake is in the game, and no further cards are dealt to that stake. Where the four jacks eventually land, those are the players. All the stakes, including those of the players who were not selected, form a pool which goes to the eventual winners of the game. Partnerships are then determined by cutting cards. In some pubs, people also bet on who will be partners.\nPlay\nThe player to dealer\'s left is the pitcher. The pitcher leads to the first trick, and the suit of the first card led becomes trumps for the remainder of the hand. The pitcher\'s partner may then pick up his or her cards. Tricks are won by the highest card of the suit led unless trumped, in which case the highest trump wins. Players must follow suit (play a card of the same suit as the card that was led) whenever possible; a player who has no card of the suit led may trump or discard at will. The winner of each trick leads to the next trick.\nScoring\nScores are often kept by pegging on a Cribbage board:\n\nWhen any of the scoring trumps (A, K, Q, J, 9, 5) or any other five is played, the team that wins the trick pegs the points shown in the left hand table above at the end of the trick.\nWhen all nine tricks have been played, each team counts the total value of the cards they have taken, according to the right hand table above, and the team that has more pegs 8 points for game. In case of a tie, neither team gets these 8 points.\nIt can be seen that the maximum number of points that it is possible to peg on the board from one hand, by winning all the scoring cards and the game is 52:\n\n4+3+2+1 = 10 for A K Q J of trumps\n10+9 = 19 for 9 and 5 of trumps\n5+5+5 = 15 for the other 5\'s\nand also 8 for game\n\nOften, fewer than 52 points are available, because some of the scoring cards are among the 16 undealt cards.\nIn Lancashire the winners are the first team to reach 91 points or more (one and a half times round the board).\nIn South Wales the first team to reach or pass 121 points (twice round the board) wins the \'leg\'. For the next leg, the partnerships remain the same, and there is a new cut for pitch, normally between the two players who did not cut at the start of the previous leg. The first team who win two legs are the overall winners of the match.\nIn Cheshire, each row of 30 holes is a "leg", so a complete game (121 points) contains four legs.\nVariations\n\n1 for high; 1 for jack; 6 for game\nKen Swain repports that in Preston, Lancashire, instead of pegging 8 points for game at the end of play, the team that has taken the greater total value in cards scores only 6 points. In addition, one point is pegged by the team that took the Jack of trumps in a trick (additional to the point scored at the end of the trick to which the Jack was played), and one point is pegged by the team that had the highest trump. If the jack was not dealt, then the jack point is not scored.\n1 for high, 1 for low, 1 for jack, 5 for game\nPhil Wrench of Macclesfield and Colin Rawlinson of Barrow in Furness report a version  in which points are scored at the end of the play for high, low, jack and game. The high point is pegged by the team that was dealt the highest trump, the low point by the team that took the trick containing the lowest trump, the jack point by the team that wins the jack (if it is dealt) and the 5 points for game are pegged by the team with most card points (in case of a tie no one gets the points). Note that these points are only pegged at the end of the play, and strictly in the order high, low, jack, game. This order of precedence can be important if both teams are close to winning.\nAnother feature of the Macclesfield game is that when the cards are cut at the start, it is the team that draws the lower card (ace counting as high) that pitches first.\nThe separate scoring of \'high\', \'low\', \'jack\' and \'game\' at the end of the play, as in its ancestor All Fours, presumably represents an older form of the game that was later simplified in many places by consolidating these scores into a single 8-point score for game.\nFour Pitches\nIn Burnley a game consists of \'four pitches\' - that is one deal by each player - at the end of which the team with the higher score wins. The \'1 for high, 1 for low, 1 for jack, 5 for game\' method of scoring is used.\nJacks Out\nIn the Cheshire Regiment the \n  formation of a Don School is heralded by the cry "Jacks Out".  People \n  then purchase a number of cards from the pack at a set price per card \n  and this becomes the kitty, to be collected by the winning team.  Each potential player is dealt the number of cards purchased, face up, and this is repeated until all the Jacks have appeared. A player who already has one or more Jacks is dealt that number fewer cards in subsequent rounds of dealing. For example a player who bought 5 cards and gets two jacks in his first 5 cards will be dealt only 3 further cards when the deal comes round to him again. The player who has the advantage of being dealt the first cards is determined by cutting a card and counting around from the (impartial) dealer (J=11, Q=12, K=13). If the four Jacks are dealt to four different people, these are the players,  paired off as red versus black.   A player who gets  two Jacks \n  may sell one on to someone who has none.  A player who is dealt three Jacks wins the kitty outright and if two players get two Jacks each they divide the kitty equally between them: the cry is "No game, Jacks out" and the purchasing of cards \n  starts again. Side bets are common, for example on the first team to reach a certain score, on who will win the 8 points for game on a particular deal, on how many tricks a team will win, and so on.\nCrib and Don League\nThe Abercarn Crib and Don League consists of 12 pub or club teams, with a minimum of five players in each team, though teams sometimes turn out with more than ten players. Nine matches are played, three of Don, three of Double Cribbage and three of Single Crib. Each of these nine matches is played as the best of three \'legs\', with the match winners scoring one point towards the team\'s total for the night.\nDouble Cribbage is four player cribbage with fixed partnerships; five cards each are dealt, one being discarded to dealer\'s box. Game is 121 points. Single Crib is two-player five card cribbage, played to 61 points.\nWhen all the matches have been played the number won by each team is added to their running total of championship points. For example, if a team wins 7 - 2 then they get 7 league championship points, whilst their opponents get 2.\nCard ranks and values\nA previous edition of this page stated that the ranking of cards in the trump suit in Lancashire from high to low was 5 9 A K Q J 10 8 7 6 4 3 2, but this was an error. Subsequent enquiries confirm that the ace of trumps is the highest card in all regions where this game is played. The misunderstanding arose because the trumps are often listed in order of their point scoring values, rather than in ranking order. Unfortunately my mistake has since been copied in various books. I apologise for my part in propagating this error.\nIn his Guinness Book of Traditional Pub Games, published in 1992 before this web page existed, Arthur Taylor listed the trumps in the order 9-5-A-K-Q-J without making it clear whether this was intended to be the ranking order. His book also gave the 5 of trumps a scoring value of 19 points rather than 10, but it seems likely that this was a misprint.\n\nIrregularities\nThe following penalties for irregulaties are those used by my informants in Bolton. \n\nPlaying out of turn\nFriendly: The card is \'boarded\', meaning the card is left face up on the table and it must be played at the next legal opportunity.\nLeague: In addition, the offending team loses 19 points from their score.\nReneging: Failing to play a card of the suit led, although you have such a card.\nFriendly: The deal is abandoned, and there is a re-deal.\nLeague: In addition, the offending team is penalised 52 points.\n\nBlind Don\nThis two player version of Nine Card Don was contributed by Bernard Scott, who learned it in a weaving mill in Burnley, Lancashire in the 1970\'s.\nIn each deal one player is dealer, the other player pitches. First pitch is decided by a cut, Ace high, winner pitches. Deal and pitch alternate.\n36 cards are dealt as follows. The first 18 cards are dealt face down, starting on the left, alternately to each player, so that each player has a row of nine cards. (This is possibly the reason for the name - Blind Don). Then 18 more cards are dealt, face up, one on top of each face down card, alternately to each player starting (again) on the left. Here is a visual example of a deal, provided by Bernard Scott.\nCard ranking and values are as Nine Card Don. Play is also as in Nine Card Don, each player playing from his own face up cards and each trick consisting of just two cards. After both players have played to a trick, any face down card that is exposed, the card on top of it having been played, is turned face up and is available for play.\nThe scoring is the same as in Nine Card Don, using the \'1 for high, 1 for low, 1 for jack and 5 for game\' version. Four pitches are played (two deals by each player), the winner being the player with the higher score.\nColin Rawlinson describes another version of Blind Don, from the Stalybridge / Hyde area near Manchester, \n  in which the two players get 7 cards each face down and then the pitcher gets 7 face-up on top of the first cards, while the dealer gets 7 face-down on top of the first cards. Then each player is dealt 4 cards face\n  as a hand, which they pick up and look at but is unseen by the other player.\n  The pitcher calls trumps on the basis of  the 4 cards in his hand and his 7\n  exposed cards, after which the dealer turns the  7 cards on top of his stacks face up  and the game commences.\n  Cards can be played from the table or the hand and in all other respects\n  the play is the same as in the version of Blind Don described above.\nColin Rawlinson also suggests a  3-player adaptation played as above, in which each player has 5 two-card stacks and 4 cards in  hand, leaving just 10 cards unused.\nIrish Don\nThis description is compiled from information from several players in Ireland, mainly in Dublin and Cork. I have also had reports of this game played in Britain by people of Irish descent.\n\nPlayers and Cards\nThere are four players in two fixed partenerships, partners facing each other across the table. A standard 52 card pack is used, the cards ranking from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2 in every suit.\nPoints are scored for the winners of tricks that contain certain cards as follows:\n\n\nAce of trumps4 points\nKing of trumps3 points\nQueen of trumps2 points\nJack of trumps1 point\n9 of trumps ("Big Don")18 points\n5 of trumps ("Little Don")10 points\nEach non-trump 99 points\nEach non-trump 55 points\n\nThere are thus 80 points to be scored in total in each deal.\nSome players play with a reduced pack of 48 or 44 cards, obtained by removing the twos and sometimes also the threes from a standard pack. The players will then have only 12 or 11 cards each; the scoring is not affected since none of the removed cards are scoring cards.\nDeal and play\nDeal and play are clockwise. Anyone can deal first. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts, and the dealer deals out all the cards, one at a time, so that everyone has 13 cards. In the first hand, the holder of the 2 "pitches" or "pucks out" (leads to the first trick). (Some groups use the 2 to determine the first pitcher.) For the next deal, the turn to pitch passes to the left, and the dealer is the pitcher in the previous hand (so the pitcher is the player to the left of the dealer). \nThe suit of the card led by the pitcher to the first trick becomes trumps for that deal. As in Nine Card Don, the pitcher\'s partner should not look at his or her cards until after this first card has been led.\nPlayers must follow suit when possible. A player unable to follow suit may play any card. A trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if no trumps are played, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nAs in most partnership card games, it is illegal to talk or give signs to your partner as to what cards you hold or what you would like partner to play. Inappropriate covert communication with your team mate is called \'billying\'.\nScoring\nRather than pegging scores during play, each team waits to the end of the play and counts the scoring cards they have in their tricks. Since all the cards are in play, the two teams\' scores must always add up to 80. Winning all 80 points in a deal is sometimes called doing the bonk.\nThe first team that scores more than 80 points wins the game. Therefore a game lasts just two deals (one pitch by each team), unless one team is so far behind at the end of the first deal that they decide to concede the game.\nIt is normal for the players just to remember the score from the first deal - no paper or peg board is used to record it. During the second deal a team that has 80 points can stop the play and claim to have won. If the second deal is played to the end and the scores are 80-80, then the last team that took a scoring trick are the losers, since the other team must have reached 80 before them.\nVariations\nSome groups play the best of three games: after the first game, the turns to deal and pitch again pass to the left so that everyone pitches once. If after four deals the teams have won one game each, the 2 or 3 is used again to determine the first pitcher for the deciding game of two deals.\nSome groups play that the overall winners are the first to win an agreed number of games.\nSome play that if the score at the end of the second deal is 80-80 the game is a draw - no one wins or loses.\nPhat\nCompiled from information from Cheshire, Rugely in Staffordshire, Motherwell and Wishaw in Scotland; Arthur Taylor reports in his book that it is also played around Norwich.\nPlayers, Cards and Objective\nThere are four players, partners sitting opposite each other. A standard 52 card pack is used.\nThe aim is to score points by winning tricks containing valuable cards. Some cards - the phat - give an immediate score to the team that wins the trick to which they are played. These are recorded on a peg board - see below. Further points are pegged after the end of the play by the team that has collected more than half of the muck in their tricks.\n\n\nThe Phat\nAce of trumps4 points\nKing of trumps3 points\nQueen of trumps2 points\nJack of trumps1 point\n9 of trumps18 points\n5 of trumps10 points\nEach non-trump 99 points\nEach non-trump 55 points\n\nMajority of muck8 points\n\nThe Muck\n\nEach Ace4 points\nEach King3 points\nEach Queen2 points\nEach Jack1 point\nEach Ten10 points\n\nThe total is 80 points.A team that collects in their tricksat least 41 points of muckpegs 8 points on the board\n\nIn Scotland, the trump nine is called the "Big Don" and the trump five is the "Wee Don", though in the English Midlands these terms are not known.\nDeal and Play\nDeal and play are clockwise. Each player cuts a card, and whoever cuts the lowest card will pitch first. The delaer will be the player to the right of the pitcher. The turn to deal passes to the left after each hand, and the pitcher is the player to dealer\'s left.\nThe dealer deals out all the cards one at a time, so that each player has 13 cards. The player to dealer\'s right (the picher\'s partner) must not pick up his or her cards until the pitcher has led.\nThe player to dealer\'s left leads first, and the suit of the card led to the first trick is trumps for remainder of the hand. Players must follow suit if they can; a player with no card of the suit led can trump or throw away at will. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if none are played, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick.\nScoring\nThe score is usually kept on a peg board which is like a cribbage board but half as long again:\n\nIn Scotland, I am told that the scores are written down on a special score sheet.\nPoints are scored or pegged at the end of each trick containing phat, and at the end of the play for muck, as described above. The first team to peg a total of 181 points (twice round the board) wins the game.\nSince there are 88 points in each deal - 80 phat plus 8 for the muck - most games are completed within four deals - one pitch by each player. If neither team has won by then a fifth deal is started, and the winners are the first team to peg enough phat to reach 181. The pitcher for the fifth deal will of course be the same as for the first deal. Note that muck cannot count in this fifth deal, since the phat will always be sufficient to allow one team to reach 181 before the end of play.\nIt sometimes happens that each team has 40 points of muck. In that case the 8 points are carried over to the next deal, and the team with more muck will then peg 16 - 8 for the new deal plus 8 carried over.\nSome play that if the muck is tied 40-40 but one team has the majority of tens (three or four), that team wins the 8 points for muck. If the tens are also divided 2-2 the muck has to be carried over as above.\nSoftware\nYou can download a freeware Don program from Thanos Card Games.\nContributors\nThanks to the following people who provided the information on which this page is based: Alan Byrne, Peter Conlon, Donncha Daly, Daniel Dunne, Pete Eccles, David Hodgson, Stephen Lowry, Les McDonald, Ian Morgan, Steve Povey, Colin Rawlinson, Simon Roberts, Tony Roberts, Bernard Scott, James Smith, Tony Street, Ken Swain, Eddie Watkins, Jim Wilkin, Richie Wormald, Phil Wrench.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > All Fours Group > Don, Phat\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1996, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2011.

The deal is unique in that all the tiles are left face down on the table in a row in front of the players.\nThe Play\nThe players draw for the lead and take turns placing tiles on either end of the train.  Doubles are played across the line, but are not spinners.\nIn his turn, each player takes one tile from the right side of his row and turns it face up.  If this is the lead for the round, it is placed in the center of the table to start the train.  Otherwise, if the tile can be played on the train, the player does so.  If the tile cannot be played on the train, the player turns it face down again and puts it on the left end of his row of tiles.\nIf a player cannot play, he passes.  The hand stops when one player dominoes or when nobody can play.  The lead for the next hand passes to the previous leader\'s left. \nScoring\nAt the end of the hand, each player gets the total number of pips in his hands.  The lowest scoring player is the winner and is credited with the sum of the scores of the losers, minus his own total.  If there is a tie for lowest score, then nobody gets a score.\nThe game is played for 100 points in a two player or partnership game, and for 61 points in a three or four handed game.  This convention allows a cribbage board to be used for keeping scores.\nBillitonnen\nThis Dutch variant is traditionally played at the end of the game of Nos to decide who will win the side pot containing the roundings. As in Nos, there are 3, 4 or 5 players. To decide who starts each player draws a tile and the highest spot value begins. In case of a tie, the tile  a higher spot value on one end counts a higher. The tiles are distributed as follows.\n\n3  players: 9 tiles each and one left over which is turned up in the centre of the table to start the layout.\n4 players: 7 tiles each\n5 players: 6 tiles each for the first three players; 5 tiles each for the other two.\n\nThe players place their tiles side by side face down in a row in front of them.\n\nWhen there are three players, the first player turns up his right hand tile and adds it to the turned up centre tile if possible, matching the ends as in ordinary dominoes. \nIf there are four or five players the first player places his right hand tile in the centre of the table to start the layout, and then turns up next tile and adds it to the line if it matches.\n\nThe same player continues to turn over tiles and add them to either end of the line, until he comes to a tile that does not fit. He places this tile at the left hand end his tiles, face down unless it is a double, in which case it is placed face up. Then it is the next player\'s turn to try to add tiles from the right hand end of his hand to the centre layout in the same way.\nA player who turns up a tile which would fit on either end of the layout is allowed to look at the next tile in his hand to help decide on which end to place the current tile.\nWhoever manages to play all his tiles first is the winner. \nOther Variants\nMost of the variations are how you turn over the tiles.  Some people allow you turn over any tile in your row, so that once you have seen all the tiles, you have full knowledge of all the tiles in play, assuming that your memory is good. \n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Western Domino Games > Blind Hughie\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net) and is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       Joe Celko, John McLeod, 2001, 2015.

The name Indian Poker is used for several games with this feature, played with different numbers of cards and different betting systems. The game has nothing whatever to do with India. The name comes from the notion that cards held to the players\' heads somehow resemble a Native American headdress or war bonnet.\nOne-Card Poker\nIn the most basic, and presumably the original version of this game, the players ante and are dealt just one card each, face down. The players pick up their cards, being careful to keep them facing outwards so that no one knows what their own card is, and hold them against their forehads so that all other players can see their values. There is then a round of poker betting and in the showdown the highest card of those who have not folded wins the pot. If several players tie for highest they share the pot - there is no order of suits in this game.\nIt is also possible to play that the lowest card wins (which makes no real difference to the game), or that the highest and lowest cards share the pot.\nMatch Pot Betting\nOne-Card Poker is often played with match pot betting, as in Guts. Players declare, either sequentially or simultaneously as agreed, whether they will stay in or drop out. The player with the best card of those who stayed in takes the pot and any others who stayed in must match the pot. \nUnlike Guts itself, Indian poker is slightly more interesting with simultaneous declaration than with sequential declaration: when they have to declare at the same time, there is the possibility that two players with high cards will both drop out, each seeing the other\'s card and assuming they are beaten, while other players may predict that this is likely to happen and take advantage of it.\nTwo or more cards\nThe same game can be played dealing two, three or more cards to each player, but this extra complexity does not make the game any more interesting. You can see how good everyone else\'s hand is, so it\'s just a question of guessing from their actions how good your cards might be, while attempting not to reveal to them what you know of their cards.\nIndian Stud Poker\nThis game is played exactly like seven-card stud, except that each player takes the first card that they were dealt and puts it to their forehead without looking at it. This card, visible only to the other players, and all other cards of the same rank are wild for the owner of the card (who is the only player who does not know what it is).  \nThe deal, betting and showdown continue as in Seven-card Stud. \nIndian Texas Hold\'em \nThis game is played the exactly same way as Texas Hold\'em except that players must not look at their two hole cards. Instead they place these two cards on their foreheads so that all the other players can see them. After the first betting round, the flop, turn and river are dealt face up to the table in the usual way, each followed by a further betting round.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Poker > Variations > Indian\n  \n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod, john@pagat.com\n John McLeod, 2011.

The basic version of the game is for four players in partnerships, but it can also be played by two or three. Watten is traditionally played with German suited cards, with suits of acorns, leaves, hearts and bells. In Bavaria a 32 card pack is used, the cards in each suit being the ace (As or Sau), king (Knig), over (Ober), under (Unter), 10, 9, 8, 7. In the Tyrolean versions it is usual to include a 33rd card, the six of bells, which is known as the WELI. In Austrian and Italian packs the card is marked WELI and is decorated with some extra suit-marks of other suits, to suggest its wild status in this and some other Tyrolean games. In the South Tyrol, Watten is sometimes played with 36 or even 40 cards.\nOutline of the game\nEach player is dealt five cards (the remainder are unused) and these are played out in tricks. In most cases there is no requirement to follow suit. The team (or player) that takes the majority of the tricks (three or more) wins two points. During the play, a team can propose to increase the number of points at stake, at which point the other team must either accept the higher stake or concede.\nIn each hand there is a trump suit, chosen by the dealer, and a trump rank (Schlag) chosen by the other team. Cards of the trump suit can be used to beat non-trump cards, and trump rank cards beat the other cards of the trump suit, with the card of the trump suit and rank (the Rechte or Hauptschlag) being the best of these. In most versions of Watten there are also some permanent trumps called Kritische, which are the highest cards, beating even the Rechte.\nBavarian Watten\nThe four-handed version of this game will be explained first. The modifications for two or three players are described later.\nPlayers and cards\nThere are four players, partners sitting opposite. A 32-card German suited pack (Bavarian pattern) is used. (Players in North America can obtain Bavarian cards from TaroBear\'s Lair.)\nThree of the cards are called Kritische; they are permanent trumps, and are always the highest cards whatever other trumps are chosen. These are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaxi - the king of hearts - the highest trump\nBelli - the seven of bells - second highest\nSpritzer or Soacha - the seven of acorns - third highest\n\nIn each hand a trump rank (Schlag) and trump suit are chosen. The fourth highest trump is the Hauptschlag - the card belonging to both the trump suit and the trump rank. Then come the other three Schlge of the same rank, which are also known as Blinde (blind cards), which are all equal in value; if two or more Blinde are played to the same trick, the first played beats the others. Below the Blinde come the remaining cards of the trump suit in descending order: ace, king, over, under, 10, 9, 8, 7 (omitting any card that is a Kritisch or Schlag). The cards in the non-trump suits also rank from high to low: A, K, O, U, 10, 9, 8, 7 omitting the Schlag rank and any Kritische.\nExamples of trumps:\n\nIf the Schlag is 10, and trump suit is hearts, the trumps rank from high to low:\nMaxi (heart K), Belli (bell 7), Spritzer (acorn 7), heart 10, the other three tens (equal), heart ace, over, under, 9, 8, 7.\nIf the Schlag is 7 and the trump suit is acorns, the trump ranking is:\nMaxi (heart K), Belli (bell 7), Spritzer (acorn 7), sevens of hearts and leaves (equal), acorn ace, king, over, under, 10, 9, 8.\nNote that in this case there is no Hauptschlag, since the Spritzer is already a Kritisch, and only one Blinde.\n\nDealing and choosing trumps\nThe game is played clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. At the start of each hand the dealer shuffles the cards and the player to dealer\'s right cuts. The cut card (the one which would become the bottom card of the pack) is shown to the players. If it is one of the three Kritische, the cutter may take it. If the card thereby revealed is a second Kritisch, the dealer may take it, and if this in turn reveals the third Kritisch the cutter may take that.\nThe dealer now deals five cards to each player - normally a packet of three cards to each, followed by a packet of two cards each. If the cutter and possibly the dealer has already taken a Kritisch, they are given correspondingly fewer cards in the first round of the deal, so that after the deal everyone has a hand of five cards.\nThe dealer and the player to dealer\'s left (who is called forehand) pick up and look at their cards. Forehand chooses what rank (ace, king, over, under, 10, 9, 8 or 7) should be the Schlag and announces it. Then the dealer chooses and announces the trump suit. Only after the Schlag and suit have been announced are the other two players (the dealer\'s partner and the cutter) permitted to pick up and look at their cards.\nThe play\nThe cards are played out in tricks, a trick consisting of one card played by each player in turn. Forehand leads to the first trick. Each trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if it contains no trump by the highest card played of the suit that was led. If the highest cards in a trick are two or more Blinde, the one that was played earliest wins the trick. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nThere is generally no requirement to follow suit - any card can be played to any trick. The only exception occurs when the Hauptschlag is led to the first trick. In that case the player leading the Hauptschlag calls "Trumpf oder Kritisch" and the other players are obliged to play a trump (i.e. a Kritisch, a Blinde or a card of the trump suit) if they have any. This obligation continues until someone beats the Hauptschlag with a Kritisch, or if that does not happen, until the end of the trick. So for example if the second player beats the Hauptschlag with the Spritzer, the third and fourth players can play whatever cards they want. But if the second player does not play a Kritisch but a lower trump, the third player is obliged to play a trump, and if this is also not a Kritisch, the fourth player must also play a trump. There is no obligation to beat the Hauptschlag with the Kritisch if you also have a Blinde or a lower trump - in that case you can play the lower trump if you wish.\nNote that if the choice of Schlag and suit is such that there is no Hauptschlag (e.g. kings and hearts), then there is no possibility to call for "Trumpf oder Kritisch" on that deal.\nThe object of the play is to win three tricks. After a team has achieved this there is no need to continue the play. Any remaining cards are thrown in and the hand is scored.\nBetting and scoring\nIf there is no betting, the team that wins three tricks scores 2 points. The first team that achieves a cumulative score of 11 or more points wins the game.\nAt any time after the Schlag rank and trump suit have been announced, a team may bet. This is indicated by a member of the betting team saying "gehen!" (i.e. "go!"). This is a proposal to increase the number of points at stake from 2 to 3. The play pauses while the opposing team decide whether to give up or to accept the increased stake. \n\nIf the opponents elect to give up (to go), the play ends, the remaining cards are thrown in (face down) and the betting side scores 2 points.\nIf the opponents refuse to give up - saying "schauen!" (see) - the play continues but the winning team will now score three points.\n\nA team that has accepted a bet to increase the stake can in their turn - either immediately or at any later point - freeze the play again by proposing to increase the stake to four points, saying "vier!". The other team must now decide whether to surrender, allowing the betting team to score three points without further play, or to continue playing for a four point stake.\nThere can be further bets "fnf!", "sechs!" and so on, the only restriction being that the teams bet alternately. A team that has already bet cannot bet again until the other team has bet.\nNote that a bet freezes the play until the other team responds. This can often happen in the middle of a trick. If the opponents of the betting team continue by playing the next card without responding to the bet, this is considered equivalent to "seeing" the bet, and play continues for the increased stake.\nA team that has 9 or 10 points is gespannt ("tight") and is not allowed to bet (though they are of course allowed to accept or see a bet made by the other team). If you are gespannt, there is in fact no point in betting, since the normal two points will already be sufficient for you to win the game if you take three tricks. If the other team have 8 points or fewer, they will always bet against the team that is gespannt, having nothing to lose by increasing the stake.\nThe score is recorded on a piece of paper or a beer mat, and when a team wins by achieving 11 points or more, the losers buy the drinks or pay a small fixed stake, as agreed in advance of the game.\nSignals\nAfter the Schlag and trump suit have been chosen, talking and discussion of tactics between partners are allowed. Partners are also permitted to signal what high cards they hold by a system of signals. The details vary somewhat, but a common system is: \n\nMaxi . . . Form lips into a kiss\nBelli . . . Wink with right eye\nSpritzer . . . Wink with left eye\nHauptschlag . . . Wrinkle the nose\nBlinde . . . Briefly extend some fingers to show number of Blinde held\nTrumps . . . Tap with middle finger to indicate number of trumps held\n\nVariations\n\nThe target score\nMany people play to a target score of 15 rather than 11. In that case a team with 13 or 14 points is gespannt and cannot bet. Some play that a team that has 12 points is already gespannt and thus prohibited from betting.\n\nThe machine\nA holding of all three Kritische is called a "machine" (Maschine), and a team that has this can of course be sure of winning all three tricks. In order to win more points, they would normally pretend at the start to have relatively weak hands to tempt the opponents to bet or at least to accept a bet. Some play that such tactics are not allowed when a single player holds a machine - i.e. all three Kritische. The holder of the machine is forced to declare it at the start, and the player\'s team simply scores two points without play.\n\nBavarian Watten for two or three players\nThe two-player game is essentially no different from the four-player game. Five cards each are dealt, the non-dealer chooses the Schlag, the dealer chooses trumps and the cards are played, with the possibility of betting at any stage as usual.\nIn the three-player game, forehand (the player to dealer\'s left) chooses both the Schlag and the trump suit and plays alone. The other two players play as a team. If the team wins both players score the relevant number of points. A separate total is kept for each player and the game is to 11 or 15 points as usual.\nTyrolean Watten\n\nThere are several small but significant differences between Tyrolean and Bavarian Watten. The most immediately obvious is the cards. In the Austrian Tyrol Watten is most often played with cards of the German suited William Tell pattern, in which the aces depict seasons of the year. In the South Tyrol and in Vorarlberg it is more usual to use the single-ended "Salzburg" pattern. In either case, a thirty-third card is added to the pack - the WELI - which is a modified six of bells, used as an extra trump.\nIn the Tyrol, Watten is often played without Kritischen, so that the card which belongs to both the Schlag rank and the trump suit, which in Austria is called "der Rechte", is the highest trump. There are also differences in the play, in that when the Rechte or any card of trump suit is led everyone must play a trump if they can\nVierer-Watten: the players and the deal\nThis is the normal Austrian game for four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite each other. The first deal is decided between two opponents who each cut the cards - whoever cuts the higher card has the slight advantage of dealing first. The player to dealer\'s right cuts but does not take or show the cut card. The dealer deals clockwise - a batch of three cards to each player, followed by a batch of two cards each. So each player has 5 cards are there is a stock of 13 cards that is not used in the game.\nChoosing trumps\nThe dealer and forehand look at their five cards. Forehand chooses and announces the Schlag, which can be any rank from ace down to six; then the dealer chooses and announces the trump suit. After that the other two players may also pick up their cards and look at them.\nThe Schlag of the trump suit is the highest card, called "der Rechte" (the right). Then come the other three cards of the same rank - "die Linken" (the lefts). The lefts are all equal; if more than one left is played to a trick, the first played beats the others. Below the lefts come the remaining cards of the trump suit, in descending order ace, king, over, under, 10, 9, 8, 7. Finally, the lowest trump is the WELI, which is always a trump no matter what suit is chosen.\nIt is possible to choose six as the Schlag, in which case the WELI will be the only Schlag and counts as the Rechte; there are no "Linken" in this case.\nIf forehand has unsuitable cards to choose a Schlag - for example small cards of five different ranks not including the WELI - forehand can ask the dealer for "schneres" (better cards). If the dealer agrees, both discard their five cards face down and the dealer deals a new five-hard hand to each from the remaining stock. Dealer is entitled to refuse the request, in which case all play with their original cards. It will sometimes happen that forehand will ask for "schneres" with a strong hand, hoping that dealer will refuse and wrongly assume that forehand has bad cards.\nThe play\nForehand, the player to dealer\'s left, leads to the first trick. A trick is won by the highest Schlag or trump in it, or if it contains no Schlag and no trumps by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next. In Tyrolean Watten, the trumps are the cards of the chosen suit (including the Rechte) and the WELI. When one of these trumps is led, any other players who hold a trump must play a either trump or a Linke. There is, however, no obligation to beat the led card. If any other card (including a Linke) is led, the other players do not have to follow suit, but are free to play any cards they wish. The Linken (the three equal Schlag cards) can therefore be played to any trick, and cannot be forced out.\nBetting and scoring\nThe game is won by the first team to reach 15 or more points. In each hand, if there is no betting, the team that takes three tricks scores two points.\nBetting works the same way as in the Bavarian game. At any time after the Schlag and trump suit have been announced, any player can bet on behalf of their team. The other team must choose whether to give up (go) for 2 points or continue playing for 3. If they decide to go on they can later try to increase the stake to 4, and if the original bettors accept this they can later try to increase the stake to 5, and so on, up to the number of points needed to win the game.\nThere is a special rule in Tyrolean Watten about betting during the last trick. This rule only applies if there has been no betting up to this point, and the teams have two tricks each. If you then wish to bet after the first card has been played to the last trick, you are only allowed to do so if your last card is either the same suit as the card led to the trick, or is a trump or Schlag (left or right).\nSome play that it is possible to bluff in this situation, betting without a card of the right suit or a trump or Schlag. If you play this way, then the opponents have four possible responses to a first bet during the last trick:\n\nTo give up, or "go", allowing the betting side to win (2 points if there has been no previous bet).\nTo hold or see the bet, playing out the last trick. The winners will score 3 points if there has been no previous bet.\nTo hold and bet in their turn, proposing that the score for the winners be increased by another point.\n\nTo say "Farbe" (suit), which is to accuse the opponents of having bet without the requisite card.  The player who bet exposes their card. If it is the same suit as the lead or a trump or Schlag, the betting side score the current value of the game (2 points if this was the first bet) even if their card would not have won the trick. If it is a different (non-trump) suit, the opponents of the betting side score the current value of the game.\n\n\nThe points scored are written down in two columns, with the scorer\'s team\'s score on the right and the opponents\' score on the left. A team that has 15 or more points has won, which is indicated by drawing a black blob (called a Bummerle) above the losers\' column.\nA team that has 13 or 14 points is "gestrichen" - a line is drawn through their score. If just one team is gestrichen, that team must decide (after Schlag and Trumps are announced and before playing to the first trick) whether to play the hand for 3 points or to give up and allow the other team to score two points. If they decide to play there is no betting. If both teams are gestrichen the cards are always played and there is no betting; the winners win the game. (These rules are really just a formal recognition of the fact that - under the usual betting rules - if you are gestrichen it is always wrong to bet, and that if your opponents are gestrichen and you are not it is always right for you to bet before a card is played).\nIn the illustration on the left the opponents of the scorer were gestrichen with 13 points and then won. It is of course possible to win without first being gestrichen, by scoring more than 2 points in the last hand. If the losing side score no points at all, they are "Schneider", which counts as a double loss. This is indicated with two blobs extended to make a pair of scissors (see right-hand illustration). A "reverse Schneider" occurs if a team which has scored nothing when their opponents are gestrichen subsequently goes on to win. This counts as a quadruple game - that is 4 Bummerlen or two pairs of scissors.\nSignals\nFrom the moment that Schlag and trumps have been announced, players can use signals to indicate to their partner what cards they hold. It is also legal to signal cards that you don\'t hold, to try to confuse the opponents. One signalling system is as follows:\n\nRechter . . . Form lips into a kiss\n1 Linker . . . Wink with one eye\n2 Linke . . . Shut both eyes\n3 Linke . . . Shut both eyes, then wink\nAce of trumps . . . Right thumb\nKing of trumps . . . Right index finger\nOver of trumps . . . Right middle finger\nUnder of trumps . . . Right ring finger\nSmall trump . . . Right little finger\nAcorn . . . Left little finger\nLeaf . . . Left ring finger\nBell . . . Left middle finger\nHeart . . . Left index finger\nPoor cards . . . Glance up at the ceiling\n\nException: if six is the Schlag, so that the WELI is the top trump, the game is played without signals. Instead, before the play begins each player is allowed to look at their partner\'s cards. Partners therefore exchange hands across the table, and having memorised their partner\'s holding, return the cards to their original holders.\nVariations\n\nWatten without signals\nSome play the game without signals. In this case, partners are allowed to look at each other\'s cards once, after Schlag and trump are announced and before the first lead. This is done by each player passing their hand across the table face down to their partner, and then returning the cards to their original owners after everyone has seen their partner\'s hand.\nWELI is always a bell\nSome play that WELI is not a wild card but always counts as a bell. Therefore it is only a trump when bells are trumps. Nevertheless it always counts as the Rechte when 6 is the Schlag, so that in this case trumps must be played when it is led.\nDer Guate\nIn the South Tyrol, some play that the trump whose rank is next above the Schlag in the natural order is the highest card in the pack, beating the Rechte. This high trump is called "der Guate" (the good one). So if 10 is the Schlag and leaves are trumps, the highest card is the Leaf Under (der Guate) followed by the Leaf Ten (der Rechte), the other tens (die Linken), and then the remaining leaves from the ace downward. If ace is the Schlag then the seven is the Guate. If six is the Schlag there is no Guate, and the WELI remains the highest trump.\nWatten with 36 cards\nIn the South Tyrol, Watten is sometimes played with 36 or even 40 cards. Domenico Starna reports that in the 36-card game played at Toblach - Dobbiaco, the Schlag can be either the WELI or an ordinary six. If "WELI" is chosen as the Schlag it is the only Schlag, there is no Guate, and the sixes of hearts, acorns and leaves are the lowest cards of their suits. If "six" is chosen as the Schlag, then the WELI counts as an ordinary six of bells (even if the dealer chooses bells as trumps) and takes its place as a Rechte or Linke. The seven of trumps is the Guate, followed by the six of trumps, then the other sixes, and then the ace of trumps. \n\nTarget score\nSome play the game to a target of 11 points (gestrichen with 9 or 10) or 18 points (gestrichen with 16 or 17) rather than 15 points (gestrichen with 13 or 14).\nImmediate bet of four\nIn the South Tyrol, some play that a team that is 4 or more points behind can make an immediate bet of 4 before the first lead. If the winning team give up the betting team scores 2 points; if the winning team accepts the bet, the score for the game becomes 4, which they can later try to increase further by betting 5 if they wish, and so on. Wolfram Steiner reports a related rule observed in Steiermark. If one team is "gespannt" with 13 or 14 points and the other team has no points at all, the situation is known as "Gespannt - Luft"; the gespannter team has to decide after trump and Schlag are announced whether to play for 4 points or give up for 2. \n\nTwo or three players\nTyrolean Watten can be adapted to be played by two or three people in the same way as the Bavarian game.\n\nKritisch-Watten\nA version of Watten with Kritischen is also played in the Tyrol. The rules are the same as for Vierer-Watten above, except that six cannot be chosen as the Schlag. There are a few permanent trumps that rank above the Rechte. The exact set of permanent trumps varies somewhat from region to region. One set of rules (from Helmut Jenewein of Innsbruck) has three Kritischen - from high to low: \nMartl (king of hearts), WELI (six of bells), Nell (seven of acorns).\nOthers play with four Kritischen - from high to low: \nMartl (king of hearts), geschriebener Weli (six of bells), kleiner Weli (seven of bells), Eichelspitz (seven of acorns)\nSome play with three Kritischen, omitting the seven of acorns from the above four. One informant described a version with two Kritischen - the Maxi (heart king) and the ober of bells, with the WELI as the lowest trump and six as a possible Schlag.\nIn the play, Kritischen can be played to any trick, and if a Kritische is led, the other players can play any cards they wish - they do not have to follow with trumps.\nWolfram Steiner gives the following set of signals for Watten with three Kritischen:\n\n\nMartl (heart king) . . . Form lips into a kiss\nWELI . . . Move your lips to the right\nSpitz (acorn VII) . . . Move your lips to the left\nRechter . . . Wink with right eye.\nLinke . . . Wink with left eye.\nAce of trumps . . . Right thumb\nKing of trumps . . . Right index finger\nOver of trumps . . . Right middle finger\nUnder of trumps . . . Right ring finger\nSmall trump . . . Right little finger\n\nBlind-Watten\nThis interesting version of the four-player game - also known as Ladinisch Watten - is played in the South Tyrol and to some extent in Steiermark. There are no Kritischen, but it is played with the Guate (see above) - so the highest card is the trump with the next higher rank above the Schlag rank. The Rechte (card of trump suit and rank) is second, then the three Linken (the other cards of the Schlag rank), the remaining cards of the trump suit from the ace downwards. In this game the WELI is usually counted as a bell whatever suit is trump, unless six is the Schlag. If ace is the Schlag the Guate is the seven; if six is the Schlag there is no Guate, the WELI is the Rechte and there are no Linken.\nThe special feature of Blind Watten is that the Schlag and trump are not announced out loud. Instead forehand privately shows the dealer a card whose rank is the Schlag, and the dealer then similarly shows forehand a card whose suit is trump. The other two players do not see these cards, and in this version the players are not allowed to look at their partners\' cards, nor to signal or communicate their cards in any other way. Therefore the partners of the dealer and forehand will only be able to deduce what are the Schlag and trump by observing the play. To aid this process the cards played to the first trick are left face up throughout the play.\nForehand and the dealer are bound by the usual Austrian rule that if the Rechte, a card of the suit chosen as trump or the WELI is led, they must follow with a trump. The other two players are not bound by this rule - they can play any card to any trick. However, this rule along with the information about who wins each trick often enables everyone to deduce what the trump suit and rank are after one or two tricks have been played.\nBetting works in the same way as in open Watten. The restrictions on betting during the last trick, whereby the bettor must have a card of the suit led or a Schlag, also apply only to forehand and the dealer.\nIn the 36-card version of Blind Watten, played at Toblach - Dobbiaco, if forehand shows the WELI it is the only Schlag and there is no Guate. If he shows one of the other sixes, this is like choosing "six" in open Watten: the seven of trumps is the Guate and the WELI counts as an ordinary six of bells, even if the dealer chooses bells as the trump suit.\nOther Watten web pages\nThe web site wattn.com describes Bavarian Watten in German and English.\nThere is a shorter  description of Bavarian Watten in German only at the Kartenspiele.net site.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Trump group > Watten\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2000, 2003, 2008.

Players have a three card hand and the aim is to collect cards in a single suit worth 31 points or as near as possible to that total. It is played in the USA, the UK and perhaps other places. In the USA it is usually called Scat, 31 or Blitz, but note that all of these names are somewhat ambiguous:\n\nThis Scat has no connection whatever with the German national card game Skat;\nThere are two other games called 31:\n\nthe German game 31, also known as Schwimmen, Schnauz or Hosen \'runter, which is like the game on this page, except that cards are swapped with a central pool of three cards, rather than using a draw and discard mechanism;\nthe banking game 31, which is similar to 21 except that the object is to draw cards adding as near as possible to 31 without exceeding it.\n\nThis Blitz is not to be confused with Dutch Blitz, which is a version of Racing Demon, sometimes played with special cards.\n\nEric Kent learned the game in the late 70\'s from older siblings, who had in turn learned it from friends visiting from the UK, and they called it Ride the Bus, and used a somewhat different method of keeping score.\n  \n\nPlayers\n\nFrom 2 to 9 or more people can play. Eric Kent suggests that the game is perhaps best when played with 3 players, but it should also work well with a larger group.\n\nCards and their value\n\nA standard 52 card deck is used. For scoring hands, the ace is worth 11 points, the kings, queens, and jacks are worth 10, and all other cards are worth their pip value.\n\nThe value of a three card hand is calculated by adding up the value of the cards held in any one suit. So if you have three cards of the same suit, you can add up all three. If only two cards are in the same suit you can add those, or use the value of the odd card if it is higher than the sum of the other two. If you have three different suits the value of your hand is the value of the highest card in it. The maximum hand value is 31, consisting of the ace and two ten-point cards in the same suit.\n\nExamples:\nK-8-5: value 23 (sum of all 3 cards)\nQ-9-8: value 17 (9 + 8)\nA-6-4: value 11 (the ace is worth more than the spades)\nJ-7-4: value 10 (the jack)\n\nDeal\n\nDetermine the first dealer in any manner you desire. The deal rotates clockwise with each hand. The cards are shuffled and the dealer deals the cards singly, starting with the player to dealer\'s left and continuing clockwise until everyone has a hand of three cards.\n\nThe next card is turned face up on the table to start the discard pile, and the remaining undealt cards are placed face down next to it to form the stock. During play, the discard pile is always kept "squared up" so that only the top card is visible and available to be taken.\n\nPlay\n\nThe player to dealer\'s left begins and the turn passes clockwise around the table. A normal turn consists of:\n\ndrawing the top card either from the stock or from the discard pile;\ndiscarding one card on top of the discard pile. \n\nNote that if you choose to take the top card from the discard pile, it is illegal to discard the same card, leaving the position unchanged. You must keep the card you took and discard one of the cards that was previously in your hand. However, if you draw the top card of the stock, you are free to discard the card that you drew onto the discard pile, leaving your hand unchanged.\nKnocking\n\nIf at the start of your turn, you believe that your hand value is at least as high as your opponents can achieve with one more turn, you can knock instead of drawing a card. Knocking ends your turn; you must keep the hand you had at the start of that turn, but each other player gets one final turn to draw and discard. After the player to the knocker\'s right has discarded, all players reveal their cards. Each player decides which suit is their point suit, and totals up their cards in that suit. \n\nThe player with the lowest hand value loses a life. If there is a tie involving the knocker, the other player(s) lose a life, but the knocker is safe. The knocker loses if his or her score is lower than that of every other player, and in that case the knocker loses two lives. If there is a tie for lowest between two or more players other than the knocker, then both (all) of those players lose a life.\n\nThere is just one case where it is possible to pick up your own discard. This happens when there are only two players left in the game and your opponent knocks. The card you discarded just before the knock is still on top of the pile, so it is now available for you to take back if you want it - for example if you had just broken up a suit for tactical reasons you can now restore it.\n\nDeclaring 31\n\nIf after drawing and discarding, or with the cards originally dealt, a player achieves hand value of 31, they show their cards immediately and claim victory. In this case all the other players lose. A player who gets 31 can declare it even after another player has knocked; victory is immediate and all the other players lose. If it happens that two or more players get 31 on the initial deal then all the players other than those with 31 lose.\n\nScoring\n\nThe normal way of scoring in Scat is that each player begins the game with three pennies. When you lose a life, you have to put one of your pennies into the kitty in the centre of the table. If you knock and lose, having the sole lowest hand, you pay two pennies (if you have that many). \n\nIf someone declares 31, all the other players have to put a penny in the kitty. If someone declares 31 after another player has knocked, the knocker just pays one penny, like everyone else.\n\nIf you have no money left, having lost all three of your pennies, you are said to be "on the county" (meaning on the dole, on welfare, receiving charity from the county, etc.), or "on your face". If you lose while on the county, you are out of the game. The game continues until only one player has not been eliminated, and that player is the winner.\n\nVariations\n\nSome play that 3-of-a-kind of any rank counts as 30 (or 30.5) points. When it counts 30, it ties with three ten-point cards of the same suit. If it counts 30.5, it beats all hands except Scat.\n\nRarely, people play that any straight-flush (three cards of the same suit in sequence) is worth 30 (except for A-K-Q, which is 31). \n\nSome play that there is a minimum score with which you are allowed to knock - for example 17, 19 or 21. \n\nA variant played in Philadelphia and perhaps elsewhere is the "throw-down". Without first looking at the cards, the first player to the left of the dealer  can call a "throw down" by exposing the hand. Everyone must show  their cards immediately - no one gets to draw a card. The "throw down"  is treated like the "knock" in that if the player who called it has the lowest hand  value, the penalty is two "lives". Obviously, this round of the game  takes very little time, thus speeding up the game.\n\nRide the Bus has a different way of keeping track of wins and losses. All players start out "seated" at the back of the bus. Players who lose a hand move toward the front in a sequence. The sequence is usually: first, you stand at the back of the bus, then you are in the middle of the bus, then at the front of the bus, then you are on the stairs, then you are off the bus. Players who are no longer "riding the bus" are out of play. Winning a hand simply keeps your position; you do not move back a step if you win a hand.\n\nThe scoring system of Ride the Bus can be changed to suit how many hands people want to play. Because this game is very casual, this often happens in the middle of the game by mutual agreement of all players; for example, a player who is "on the stairs" loses another hand and would normally be out of play, but since everyone is having so much fun, it is declared that the player is "on the second step" or "asking the driver to stop" instead of out. If extra levels are introduced, they apply to all players.\n\nOn the site Cribbage.ca is a description of a French Canadian version of 31 in which after a player has knocked and everyone else has taken a turn, the player with the highest score is awarded one point. If there is a tie the player who did not knock wins it. Presumably if there is a tie between two players neither of whom knocked they get a point each. A player who makes 31 declares it and score a point immediately. The game apparently goes on until someone reaches a score of 31 - a long game.\nScat software\nYou can download Ryan Skeldon\'s free Blitz 31 for Windows.\nOn the cbc.ca kids site you can play a version of this game called High Hat against computer opponents.\nHere is Bob Dolan\'s Scat program for Windows.\nSolitaire Online has published a version of Ride the Bus that can be played free online in a browser against computer opponents. In this version you can signal the bus to stop after drawing a card and before discarding, but the bus cannot be stopped in your first turn to play.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Draw and Discard Games > Scat\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1998, 2006.

Club of America. I have added some common variations.\n\nIntroduction\nPlayers and CardsSequence of Hands\nObject of the Game\nDeal\nBidding\nPlay\nScoring\nVariations\nRelated Games\nOther Oh Hell WWW Pages\n\nSoftware, Online Games, Score Sheets and Scoring Applications\n\nIntroduction\nThis game, in which players try to predict the exact number of tricks they will win, first appeared in London and New York in the 1930\'s and has since become popular in many parts of the world. Its original name Oh Hell! evidently offended some people and has been bowdlerised in many books to Oh Pshaw! or Oh Well!, while others  have preferred more robust alternatives such as Oh Shit! Some call it Blob or Blackout, perhaps because of the practice of recording a player\'s bid on the scoresheet and then obliterating it with a black blob if the player failed to take the predicted number of tricks. Traditionally the size of the players\' hands increases or decreases by one in each deal, and this has given rise to the names Elevator (l\'Ascenseur in France), Up and Down the River (in Australia and New Zealand) and 10 op en neer in the Netherlands. In Britain it is often known as Nomination Whist, a name which also sometimes refers to different games. Other names include Bust (in Australia and New Zealand), Boerenbridge (in the Netherlands), Kachuful (in India) and German Bridge (in Hong Kong).\nPlayers and Cards\n\nFrom 3 to 7 people can play. The game is best when played with 4 to 6.\n\n\n\n  A standard 52 card deck is used. The cards in each suit rank (from high to low) A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.\n  \nSequence of Hands\n\nThe game consists of a series of hands. The first hand is played with 7 to 10 cards dealt to each player, depending on the number of players:\n\n3 to 5 players, 10 cards each;\n6 players, 8 cards each;\n7 players, 7 cards each\n\n(because of the limit of 52 cards available). Each successive hand is played with one card fewer, down to a hand of just one card each, then one card more per hand back up to the starting level. \n\nExample: With 7 players, the hands are: 7 cards, then 6,5,4,3,2,1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7, for a total of 13 hands to the game. A game should take approximately 45 minutes.\n\nObject of the Game\n\nThe object is for each player to bid the number of tricks he thinks he can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many; no more and no fewer. Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly, and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or under (see scoring below).\n\nThe hook is that at least one player will fail on each hand, because the total number of tricks bid by the players may not equal the number of tricks available on that hand.\n\nDeal\n\nTo determine the first dealer, draw cards. The player with the highest card deals first. The turn to deal rotates clockwise with each hand.\n\nThe cards are shuffled and cut and the dealer deals the cards singly until everyone has the appropriate number of cards for the hand being played. The next card is turned face up and the suit of this card is the trump suit for the hand. The trump suit beats any of the other three suits played in that hand. The remaining undealt cards are placed in a face down stack with the turned trump on top of it.\n\nBidding\n\nThe bidding in each hand begins with the player to the left of the dealer, then continues clockwise, back around to the dealer, who bids last. Each bid is a number representing the number of tricks that player will try to take. Everyone must bid - it is not possible to pass, but you can bid zero, in which case your object is to take no tricks at all. A bid may be changed only if the next player to the left has not yet bid. Remember the hook: the dealer may not bid the number that would cause the total number of tricks bid to equal the number of tricks available; a hand will always be "over-bid" or "under-bid". Keep in mind when bidding that not all cards in the deck are in play in any hand.\n\nPlay\n\nThe play begins with the player to the dealer\'s left, who leads the first card. The lead may be any suit (including trump). Play follows clockwise. Each player must follow the suit led, if he can. If not, he may play any other card in his hand, including trump. The player who has played the highest trump card, or if no trump was played, the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick. That player then leads to the next trick. Continue until all tricks have been played and won.\n\nScoring\n\nThe scorekeeper is designated prior to each game according to house rules. The scorekeeper, needless to say, has a distinct advantage, and should be monitored closely for "inadvertent" errors. The designated scorekeeper notes each bid and resulting scores on a score sheet. There are many different ways to score Oh Hell!\n\n\nIn the simplest version, a player who wins the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the number of tricks bid (10 points for zero tricks, 11 for 1 trick, 12 for two tricks, etc.) Players who take more or fewer tricks than they bid score nothing. This method has the advantage that the scorekeeper, having written down the bids at the start of the play, can simply write a figure "1" in front of those that were successful and delete those that are not. The game with this scoring method is often known as Blackout or Blob, because the scorer obliterates or blacks out unsuccessful bids, so that they become black blobs on the score sheet. \n\nPerhaps the most widespread scoring method is to award 1 point for each trick won plus a bonus of 10 points for players who win exactly the number of tricks they bid. So for example a player who bid 2 would score 12 points for winning exactly 2 tricks, but only 1 for 1 trick and 3 for 3 tricks. This gives a player whose bid fails a slight incentive to win as many tricks as possible.\n\nSome other scoring methods are given in the variations section below. Whatever method is used, the score keeper keeps a cumulative total of each player\'s score. The final cumulative scores determine the result. If the game is played for money, players pay or receive amounts corresponding to the difference of their scores from the average.\n\n\nSeveral people have produced preprinted Oh Hell score sheets and applications, reflecting various scoring methods. \nVariations\nSequence of Hands\n\nThere are a lot of variations of this. Some people start from 1 card each, go up to the maximum number of cards and then back down to 1. Some just go from the maximum down to 1 and then stop, or vice versa. If there are four people the maximum number of cards dealt may be 13 rather than 10, with three people you can go up to 17. Some people go up to some other maximum, such as 7 cards, irrespective of the number of players.\n\nDan Strohm describes a version, called Devil\'s Bridge, in which the hand size increases and then decreases. On the final 1 card hand, the players must each hold their card on their forehead, so each player can see all the other player\'s cards but not their own.\n\n\nBryce Francis reports that in Australia, when playing Bust with 5 players, they add 13 low cards from a second pack to make a 65 card pack, so as to deal 13 cards each on the first hand as with 4 players. When there are six players they add a further 13 low cards, so that the bottom half of the pack is duplicated. If duplicate cards are played to a trick, the second played beats the first.\n\nA 3-player game is also possible, removing 13 low cards from a single pack.Determining Trumps\n\nSome sequences include hands in which all cards are dealt (for example 13 cards each to 4 players). There is of course then no card left to determine the trump suit. These hands are played without trumps. Some play the largest deals without trumps even if not all the cards are used.\n\nInstead of turning up a card, some people go through the possible trump suits in a fixed sequence. This sequence may or may not include "no trumps".\n\nIn the Indian (Gujurati) game Kachuful, the sequence of trump suits is spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts and the name of the game, which literally means \'raw flower\', is also a mnemonic for this sequence: Ka = Kari = Spades,\nChu = Chukat = Diamonds, \nFu = Falli = Clubs, L = Lal = Hearts\n\n  Brad Wilson describes a version called "Oh Shit!" in which Spades are always trumps.\n\nJean-Pierre Coulon reports a variation in which after the appropriate number of cards have been dealt to the players, the next card is turned face up. If the rank of the turned up card is from 2 to 6, there are no trumps for the deal; if it is 7 or higher, the suit of the turned up card is trumps.\n\nBidding\n\nSome people play without the hook rule, so the dealer is allowed to bid in such a way that everyone can win. There was a lively discussion in rec.games.playing-cards as to which version is more skilful, with strong advocates of each. Some think that hands where the bids add up are too easy; but others say that forcing the bids not to add up removes a tactical option from the dealer.\n\nSome play with simultaneous bidding. When the players are ready to bid, they put a fist on the table.  When everyone\'s fist is out, the group says "One, Two, Three" while bouncing their fists on the table. On Three, everyone must stick out some number of fingers (possibly zero) to indicate how many tricks they will try to take. Of course, with this method, there\'s no restriction against the total number of bid tricks being equal to the number of cards dealt. Since players cannot adjust their bids based on the other players\' bids, the total tricks bid can be wildly different from the tricks available - for example it is not uncommon for three or four players to bid "one" when only one card was dealt. Several correspondents report that in Australia, most groups use simultaneous bidding rather than bidding in turn.\n\nPlay\nSome play that the dealer, rather than the player to dealer\'s left, leads to the first trick.\nDavid Wuori (of Maine, USA) reports a variation in which a player who has no card of the suit led must trump. Only if you have no cards of the suit led and no trumps can you discard from a different non-trump suit. Although this is rule is uncommon in English speaking countries, it is actually the usual way of playing La Podrida (the Spanish equivalent to Oh Hell played in Latin America and in Spain) as well as the equivalent Romanian game of Whist.\nMark Brader suggests a variation in which two jokers are included, to make a 54-card deck. These jokers are a suit of their own containing just two equal cards. If a joker is led it wins the trick unless trumped. If a joker is turned up the other joker is the only trump. \nDick Atkinson reports a version of Blackout for 5 or 6 players, played in Northeast England in the 1970s. Two jokers are added to the pack, and if there are 5 players the four deuces are removed leaving 50 cards. With 5 players the deal is always 10 cards each and with 6 players 9 cards each. The trump suit rotates from deal to deal in the order hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades. The dealer could not make the bid total equal the number of cards dealt. Jokers could not be led (unless the player had no other cards) and could not be played in  the first trick. Apart from that, a joker could be played to any trick (even if the player could have followed suit). The first player of a joker could nominate it as either "high", automatically winning the trick or "low", automatically losing. The player of the second joker had no choice: it would be low if the first joker was high and high if the first was low. If a player was forced to lead a joker, the first suited card played determined the suit of the trick.\nScoring\n\nThere are many alternative systems.\n\nSome players give the usual 10-point bonus for a successful positive bid but award only 5 points for a successful bid of zero. Others award 5 plus the number of cards dealt to each player for a successful zero bid, recognising the fact that zero is more difficult when more cards are dealt.\nSome score 10 points for each trick bid and won for a successful bid. A successful "zero" bid wins 10 points. A player whose bid is unsuccessful (over or under) loses 10 points times the difference between the number of tricks won and the number of tricks bid.\nAnother system is that you win 5 points if you are right plus 10 for each trick taken, and you lose 5 points if you are wrong plus an extra 5 for each trick difference from your bid.\nYet another system: if you make your bid exactly you score 10 points plus the square of the number of tricks you bid (i.e. 10 points for none, 11 for one, 14 for two, 19 for three, 26 for four, etc.); if you fail you lose the square of the difference between the number of tricks you bid and the number of tricks you took.\nSome play for a single winner, who is the player with the highest score when the whole series of hands has been played. In case of a tie after the last hand, some deal further hand(s) with the maximum number of cards until a clear winner is determined. The winner may not be any of those involved in the original tie - any player can win until the end.\n\nMore variations\nThe Oh Hell Variations page in the Invented Games section of this site has a collection of Oh Hell variations contributed by readers.\nA version of Oh Hell! under the Dutch name Boerenbridge was formerly available to play against three computer opponents at  Kaartspellen online (www.useme.nl/kaartspellen). In the variation offered there: \n\n\nThe whole pack is dealt every time - 13 cards each to four players. \nBidding is simultaneous. \nScore 1 point for each trick won, plus a bonus of 10 is you make your bid exactly. \nIf you bid and make zero you score 20 points. \nIf your score is 80 or more you do not take part in the bidding, but just score 1 for each trick you win. \nThe objective is to score exactly 100; if you go over 100 you bounce back - your excess over 100 is subtracted from 100. \n\n\nRelated games\n\nLa Podrida is the equivalent Spanish game to Oh Hell!, played with a 52-card pack. There is also a similar game La Pocha, played with the 40-card Spanish deck. \n\nRomanian Whist is a variation of Oh Hell!, played in Romania with a 32-card pack.\n\n\nDavid Parlett\'s 36-card game Ninety-Nine is based on similar principles, but with an extra twist to the bidding.\n\nGerman Bridge is a version of Oh Hell played in Hong Kong.

Most of the tiles are dealt to the players, and the tiles that remain in the boneyard are not used. There are any number of variations on the game and I will try to give a representative set of rules.\nNote: Four-player games in which all dominoes are dealt and there is no boneyard have now been moved to other pages: Partnership Dominoes, Caribbean Dominoes, Gallinazo.\nEquipment\nThe game uses a double six domino set, but other sets can also be used when you have more players.\nThe Deal\nThe size of the hand varies with the number of players:\n\n\n2 players get 7 tiles each\n3 players get 5 tiles each\n4 players get 5 tiles each\n\n\n\nThe rest of the tiles stay in the boneyard and are not used in the round.\nThe Play\nThe four handed game can be played in partnerships or as individuals.  The players draw for the lead and take turns placing tiles on either end of the train.  Doubles are played across the line, but are not spinners.  A player who cannot play passes.  The round stops when one player dominoes or when nobody can play.  The lead for the next round passes to the previous leader\'s left.\nScoring\nAt the end of the hand, each player gets the total number of pips in his hands.  The lowest scoring player is the winner and is credited with the sum of the scores of the losers, minus his own total.  If there is a tie for lowest score, then nobody gets a score.\nThe game is played for 100 points in a two player or partnership game, and for 61 points in a three or four handed game.  This convention allows a cribbage board to be used for keeping scores.\nVariations\nVariations include:\n\n\nDifferent numbers of tiles in the hands.  \nDrawing for high tile to determine the lead in the first hand, then rotating the lead for the following hands.\nDrawing for high tile to determine the lead in the hand after a blocked round.\nDetermining the lead by requiring that the highest double be lead first.\n  \n\n\nIn Britain, some clubs change the scoring\n  \n\nIf the winner dominoes with a tile that could have been played on either end of the train, his opponent\'s scores are doubled.  \nThe opponents points are doubled if the winner dominoed with a double.\n\n\n\nComments & Strategy\nThe best play is to set your strongest suit, preferably with a double, so that you will have more options for further plays when it is your turn again.  This also tells your partner what your strong suit is so he can play to it.\nThe better control you have of a suit, the more you should try to leave that suit on the ends of the train.\nIn a partnership game, you can assume that your partner\'s lead is his strongest suit and play to it.\nOther Web Pages and Software\nThere is a separate page with details of the Indonesian Block Domino game Gaple and a separate page for Austrian Dominoes, often played as a block game with 36 tiles (an [8-8] set without doubles).\nFour-player partnership domino games in which all the tiles are dealt - seven to each player - are  covered on the Partnership Domino page and the Caribbean Dominoes page. Gallinazo is a four-player game with all tiles dealt in which each player plays for himself.\n\nRules for Block Dominoes can also be found on the Domino Plaza site.\n\nDomino Software and Online Games\nGame Colony offers head to head Block Dominoes games and multi-player tournaments, which can be played free or for cash prizes.\n\n\n  The Dominoes On Line web site enables you to play dominoes live over the Internet.\nRubl.com offers a two-player online block domino game for prizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Western Domino Games > Block Dominoes\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net) and added to by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       Joe Celko, John McLeod 2001, 2006, 2008.

The player with the highest double places it as the lead for the round.  If nobody has a double, all players draw another tile from the boneyard until someone has a double to lead.\nOther players take turns placing tiles on the spinner in the usual manner.  If a player cannot play, he passes.  The hand stops when one player dominoes or when nobody can play.  The lead for the next hand passes to the previous leader\'s left.\nThe two major variations differ in how to handle the remaining doubles.  In one version, the remaining doubles are played across the line, but are not spinners.  In the other version, all doubles are spinners.\nScoring\nAt the end of the hand, each player gets the total number of pips in his hands.  The lowest scoring player is the winner and is credited with the sum of the scores of the losers, minus his own total.  If there is a tie for lowest score, then nobody gets a score.\nThe game is played for 101 points in a two player or partnership game, and for 61 points in a three or four handed game.  This convention allows a cribbage board to be used for keeping scores.\nComments & Strategy\nThe best play is to set your strongest suit, preferably with a double, so that you will have more options for further plays when it is your turn again.  The better control you have of a suit, the more you should try to leave that suit on the ends of the train.\nIn a partnership game, you can assume that your partner\'s lead is his strongest suit and play to it.\nVariations include:\n1) Different numbers of tiles in the hands\n2) Drawing for high tile to determine the lead in the first hand, then rotating the lead for the following hands.\n3) Drawing for high tile to determine the lead in the hand after a blocked round.\n4) Determining the lead by requiring that the highest double be lead first.\n5) The game can also be played with larger sets, such as the double nine game or even the double twelve set. With the double nine set, play starts with tiles added to both long sides and both short sides of the spinner, thus giving four arms.  With the double twelve domino set, tiles are added to all four sides and all four corners, thus giving a spinner with eight arms.  No tile may be played until all arms of the initial double have been started.\n6) In the traditional Dutch variant, a player, when he cannot play, draws one or two dominoes from the boneyard, and passes his turn if this does not give him a playable tile. The last two tiles of the boneyard are not drawn and remain unused. The double zero counts as 13 points.\n7) The single spinner version is a playable game with some interest, but the all spinners version simply has too many open ends that you can match to be of much interest.  In fact, the table can get so crowded with lines of dominoes that you have to bend them around corners or "chicken foot" them.  The expression "chicken foot" refers to placing the tiles on the sides of a spinner at angles pointing away from the center of the tableau so that lines of tiles do not run into each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Western Domino Games > Block Dominoes with Spinners\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net).\n      \n       Joe Celko 2001.

The practice of varying the number of cards dealt on each hand and of determining the trump suit at random is slightly reminscent of Oh Hell!, but the objective in this game is always to win tricks, not to take the exact number that were bid.\nThe first version of Back Alley described on this page, which seems to be the more prevalent, may have originated in the 1960\'s during the Vietnam war. It is a partnership game, normally played with two jokers, known as bloopers, and the game itself is sometimes called Blooper. It has a fairly strong similarity to Spades, in that the bids of the partners are added together.\nThe second version is played without partners. There are no jokers, and the 2 is usually the highest trump. This version corresponds more closely to the original game played in the 1940\'s.\nPartnership Back Alley\nPlayers\nThere are four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The game is played\nclockwise.\nCards\n54 - a standard 52 card pack with two distinguishable jokers, big and little. The jokers are known as bloopers or blookers. The cards in each non-trump suit rank from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. The big blooper is the highest trump and the little blooper is second highest, so the order of trumps is BB-LB-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2.\nDeal\n13 cards each in the first hand, then one card fewer each successive hand down to one card each. Then a second hand with one card dealt to each player and  rising again to a final deal of 13 each, so that there are 26 deals in a complete game. Turn to deal passes clockwise. So a complete game consists of 25 deals. After the four hands have been dealt the next card is turned up and its suit is trumps for the hand. If the turn up is a joker (blooper) there are no trumps and the holder (if any) of the other joker must discard it and take the next undealt card in exchange.\nBidding\nStarting to dealer\'s left, each player in turn has just one bid. The possible bids are \'pass\', a positive whole number, or \'board\'. There is no requirement for each bid to be higher than the previous one.\n\nIf all pass the cards are thrown in and there is a new deal of the same number of cards by the next dealer. \nIf both members of a team bid a number, those numbers are added and the team\'s aim is to win at least that many tricks. A pass counts as zero. So if the members of a team bid 1 and 4 they try to win at least 5 tricks between them. If they bid pass and 3 they try to win at least 3 tricks. If both pass they have no minimum target, though any tricks they do win will benefit them slightly. The maximum number bid allowed is one less than the number of cards dealt.\nA player who bids \'board\' commits his or her team to try to win all the tricks. If more than one player bids board, the second board bid is a \'double board\', the third is a \'triple board\' and the fourth is a \'quadruple board\'.\n\n\n\nPlay\nThe highest bidder leads to the first trick. If more than one player bid the same number the earliest of those bidders leads. If more than one player bid a board the last of them leads.\nPlayers must follow suit. If unable to follow suit you may play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if it contains no trumps, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\nIt is illegal to lead a trump unless either \n\ntrumps have been \'broken\' - i.e. someone has already played a trump to a previous trick, or\nyou have bid a board (or a double, triple or quadruple board).\n\nIf the big blooper is led to a trick, each of the other players must play their highest trump. If the little blooper is led the other players must play their lowest trump (note that the little blooper might still be beaten if someone\'s only remaining trump was the big blooper). These constraints do not apply when a blooper is played other than as the first card of a trick. Also, a player who has no trumps is free to discard any card when a blooper is led.\nScoring\nA team which wins at least as many tricks as they bid scores 5 points per trick bid, plus 1 point for each trick won in excess of the bid. If they win fewer tricks than they bid, they lose 5 points for each trick bid.\nA team which bid board scores 10 points per trick if they succeed in winning all the tricks; if they fail they lose the same amount (e.g. 50 points in a five card hand). A team which bid double, triple or quadruple board wins 2, 3 or 4 times as much. (When a team bids board only their highest bid counts; the other partner\'s bid does not affect the score). \nVariations\n\nBoards\nSome play that after any player has bid board, the player\'s partner may increase the team\'s bid to a double board, which scores 15 points per trick. So if you started with a number and your partner bid board, you could increase it to double board. In this version it is possible for both teams to bid board or double board independently of each other; there is no triple or quadruple board bid. In determining the first lead, I think that double board takes precedence over board, and between two equal bids, the player whose first turn to bid was earlier has precedence.\nBoston\nThis is a bid, in a hand with more than 6 cards dealt, undertaking that the bidding team will win the first 6 tricks. It is worth 100 points for the first 6 tricks plus 1 for each additional trick. If the bidding team loses any of the first 6 tricks, they lose 100 points.\nRainbow\nIn this popular variation, when exactly four cards are dealt, a hand consisting of one card of each suit is called a rainbow. This can be announced at the player\'s turn to bid for an extra bonus of 40 points provided that the player wins at least one trick. The rainbow player leads to the first trick. In the event that more than one player bids rainbow, the first rainbow bidder leads to the first trick.\nSome also allow rainbow to be announced with 2 cards of each suit in the 8-card deal for 80 points and with 3 cards of each suit in the 12-card deal for 120 points. To score these points the rainbow player has to win at least 2 tricks with an 8-card rainbow and at least 3 with a 12-card rainbow.\nIf the rainbow player fails to take the required tricks (at least 1 trick with four cards, 2 tricks with 8 cards, 3 tricks with 12 cards), the rainbow points are subtracted from the team\'s score instead of added. Partner\'s tricks do not help here - if you announce a rainbow you have to take the required tricks yourself or lose the points. Of course, a player with a rainbow hand is not obliged to announce the rainbow, and should not do so unless there is a good chance of winning the required tricks.\nThe rainbow announcement also counts as a normal bid of the relevant number of tricks, and the player can increase it by announcing "rainbow+1", "rainbow+2", etc. This is then added to partner\'s bid as usual. Example: with 8 cards dealt North bids "rainbow+1" (meaning 3 tricks) and South bids 1. This commits the team to win at least 4 tricks. If North wins 2 and South wins 3 they will score +101 points: 80 for the rainbow, 20 for the bid and one for the overtrick. If North wins 2 tricks and South 1 they score +60, winning 80 for the rainbow but losing 20 for the failed bid. If North wins 1 trick and South wins 3 they score -60, losing 80 for the rainbow but winning 20 for the bid.\nSome play the rainbow announcement without the trick-taking requirement. Announcing a rainbow with 4 cards at your turn to bid simply gives your team a bonus of 40 points as compensation for telling everyone that you have a card of every suit. The rainbow player also makes a normal bid or pass which is added to partner\'s bid in the usual way.\nUsually a player who has announced a rainbow is required to keep their cards on the table in front of them as they are played, rather than have them gathered up with the tricks, so that everyone can verify that the rainbow player really has the claimed distribution of suits.\nBlind bids\nSome play that at the halfway point up and down (the 7-card deals with 4 players), the hands are bid "blind" (i.e. without looking at the cards). In this version, if a joker is turned as trump it is "burned" (put at the bottom of the deck) and trump is determined by the next card turned. In the case where both jokers are "burned" and there are no more cards available (i.e. at the 13-card deal with 4 players), there is no trump. The score is the number of tricks bid plus the number of tricks won if the bid is successful. If the tricks won are less than tricks bid, the team loses 2 points per trick bid regardless of how many were won. There are no "board" bids.\n\n\nNumber of players and individual play\n3 players can play as individuals, starting at 13 cards each and working down to 1 card and back to 13 as usual. 4 can play as individuals rather than in partnerships. 5 can play as individuals, starting and ending at 10 cards each. I have been told that 6 could play - presumably they form 2 teams of three or 3 teams of two.\nBig blooper\nSome play that when your partner leads the big blooper, you do not have to waste your highest trump: you are allowed to follow with a low trump. Some say that you must play your lowest trump - which is usually what you would wish to do anyway.\nCards dealt\nI have been told that some do not vary the deal, but deal the same number of cards each time - presumably 13.\nSome play 25 deals rather than 26, with just one one-card deal in the middle.\n\nGame with high two of spades\nThis 26-deal game is played with a 52-card deck without jokers. The game begins with a 1-card deal, then increases one at a time to the maximum 13 cards and decreases again to 1 card. There are two 13-card deals in the middle, and in these the deck is cut before dealing to determine trumps. The two of spades is normally the highest trump, above the ace, and counts as belonging to the trump suit. The exception is when the two of spades is cut or turned for trump, in which case there are no trumps. \nTrumps cannot be led except in two cases: (a) when the leader is "tight" (holds nothing but trumps) and (b) the leader holds two of spades and chooses to lead it. When the two of spades is led the other players must play their highest trumps to this trick. The player who led the spade two can then continue to lead trumps (but the other players do not have to play high) until he loses a trick. Once the player who led the spade two loses a trick or leads anything other than trump, it is again illegal to lead trumps unless the player on lead is tight.\nPlayers sitting opposite are partners, but the scoring is based on the tricks won by individual players compared to their bids, and the partners\' scores are then combined. The score is 10 points per trick bid and made plus one for each overtrick. If the bid fails the loss is 10 points per trick bid. Example: if North bids 4, South bids 2 and they win 3 tricks each, then North scores -40 and South +21 for a total of -19 for the partnership.\nBoard can be bid only on the 1-card deals: after a player has bid 1, another player can bid "board" for 20, a third player "double board" for 30 and the last player "triple board" for 40.\nOn a deal of 7 or more cards,  if any player has no trumps the hands are thrown in and redealt, unless it was a no-trump deal (two of spades cut or turned for trump).\n\nReduced Deck\nI have seen one report of a version played with a reduced deck of 42 cards, with 4\'s, 3\'s and 2\'s removed. In the first hand 10 cards each are dealt and this is reduced by one for each subsequent hand as usual.\n\nAll: game without jokers\nOne correspondent reports a variation known as "All", played without jokers (in the 13-card deals the cards are cut for trump before dealing). Instead of the "board" bid, there is a bid of "all", allowed only when 5 or fewer cards each are dealt. This is a commitment that the player\'s team will win every trick and scores 25 points if successful or loses 25 points if not.\n\nSpades trump\nSome play with Spades as permanent trumps, instead of turning up a card for trumps on each deal.\n\nRedeal\nSome play that when a hand of 6 or more cards are dealt, a player who has no aces, no face cards and no trumps is allowed to demand a new deal by the same dealer.\n\nIndividual Back Alley\nThis version of the game dates from World War II. It is played with a 52 card pack without jokers. The two of diamonds is highest trump, followed by the Ace of the trump suit, so the trumps rank 2-A-K-Q-J-10-9- etc.\nThe game is played by two, three or four players, without partners. If there are fewer than four players there will be undealt cards, even in the 13-card hand.\nThere are 14 deals in a game. In the first deal, 13 cards are dealt to each player. In each subsequent deal, the number of cards dealt is reduced by one, and the last two deals are of one card each.\nBefore the 13-card deal with 4 players, the cards are cut to determine the trump suit; in all other deals, the first undealt card is turned up to determine the trump suit. If the 2 is cut or turned up, diamonds are trumps.\nEach player in turn bids a number of tricks. A bid of no tricks is a pass, and if all players pass, the hand is redealt by the same dealer.\nThe highest bidder leads to the first trick; if there were several equally high bids the first of these bidders leads. Any card can be led - there are no restrictions on leading trumps. It is compulsory to follow suit whenever you can; note that (unless diamonds are trumps) the 2 is not a diamond but is treated as belonging to the trump suit. A player unable to follow suit to a non-trump lead must trump. If a non-trump lead has already been trumped, a subsequent player who is unable to follow suit must beat the highest trump in the trick if possible - if unable to do this he may play any card. A player who is unable to follow suit may play any card.\nFor the hands with more than one card dealt, if you make at least as many tricks as you bid, you score 3 points for each you bid, plus one extra point for each trick you make in excess of your bid. If you fail to make as many tricks as you bid, you lose 3 points for each trick that you bid, irrespective of how many you made.\nIf you bid for all the available tricks, this is called board, and you win 6 points per trick bid if successful and lose 6 points per trick bid otherwise. There are no double board bids, but it is possible for more than one player to bid board.\nOn the one card deals, you only options are to bid board - for which you win 13 points if you win the trick and lose 13 points if you don\'t - or to pass - in which case you score no points regardless of whether or not you win the trick.\nVariations of Individual Back Alley\n\n18 deal game\nSome start at a deal of 9 cards each, work down to 1 (twice) and back up to 9 for a total of 18 deals. A player who has one cards of each suit in a 4-card deal can declare this during the bidding for a 5-point bonus. Declaring two cards of each suit in the 8-card deal gives a 10-point bonus. A board bid is worth an extra 10 points if successful, but loses an extra 10 points if it fails. The correspondent who reported this version calls it "Oh Hell", a name which is normally used for a different game in which the aim is to take the exact number of tricks that are bid.\n\nTwos of diamonds and trumps high\nSome play that if diamonds are not trumps, the second highest trump is the two of the trump suit, and the trump ace is third highest.\n\n26 deal version\nThis may have originated in the Korean War. There is no high two - the ace of trumps is highest. After the two one-card deals, further hands are played with the number of cards dealt to each player increasing by one each time, up to the maximum 13. Trumps cannot be led until they have been broken. Players score 5 points each for tricks bid and made, plus 1 point for each overtrick. A player who makes fewer tricks than they bid loses 5 points per undertrick. A player can bid "bort" (presumably a corruption of "board"), an undertaking to win every trick, scoring 10 points per trick if successful, but otherwise losing the full amount of the bid. In the four-card deal a player with a "rainbow" (one card of each suit) can declare it during the bidding for a 40 point bonus. The cards are not shown at this stage: the other players should check that the player really has the claimed rainbow. A false rainbow announcement loses 40 points.\nThis game is intermediate between the two main versions described on this page. It is an individual game, but the deal sequence, the play (no trump leads until broken), the scoring and the rainbow bid are more typical of the newer partnership game.\n\nOther Back Alley WWW Pages\nThis archive copy of Sgt Grit\'s Back Alley Bridge Rules gives another description of the game with bloopers.\nA commercial version of Back Alley was advertised at http://www.backalleygames.com but the web site has since disappeared. I have not seen the actual product, but there were some rules on the web page. The game is related to WWII game described above, and there are no partnerships. It is played with a special pack of 56 cards: four suits of 13 plus four identical wild cards. No card is turned for trumps - the only trumps are the four wild cards. If you can\'t follow suit you must trump with a wild card if you have one, and when a wild card is played subsequent players are released from the obligation to follow suit in that trick and may play any card. If several wilds are played to a trick the first wins. It\'s illegal to lead a wild card unless you have nothing else in your hand. Before play each player can discard one card and draw one of the undealt cards. Score is 3 points per trick bid plus 1 per overtrick if successful; lose 3 per trick bid if unsuccessful.\nContributors\nMost of the information on this page is based on  e-mails and news postings from Charles Petro, Howard L Wagner, Rand  Collins, Daniel Grimes, Cindy Ingels, Douglas Nitch, David Brandt, Amber  Sexton, Becky B, Tim Arview and Vincent Higginbotham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Boston group > Back Alley\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2001, 2003, 2007.

It is popular in the province of New Brunswick, on the Atlantic coast of Canada. It is said to be a French Acadian game. In French it sometimes known  as Deux Cents (200) and sometimes as Dix or Bidder 10 (Tens). Versions played in Quebec are also known as Le Rough or Le Ruff  and around the eastern townships La Bloutte or La Fouine. There are some players in neighbouring Maine, USA, for example in Fort Kent, where the game is called La Bloute, and I have received two reports  from as far away as Alberta where it is called Tens or Barouche. The only book descriptions of versions of this game that I have been able to find are in Culbertson\'s Hoyle (1950) under the name \'Chinese Bridge (four-hand)\', and in French under the name \'Le Ruff\' in Richard Raymond\'s Rgles des Jeux de Cartes st des Patiences (2nd ed 2006) credited to Marie-Anna Bois of Quebec.\nThe age and origins of 200 are uncertain, but it is likely to have originated in Canada. It is best known in New Brunswick, where several correspondents say that it has been played for at least 3 or 4 generations, so clearly it was already known there in the 1930\'s or earlier. It is closely related to Rook, a game with special cards played in the Midwest USA and Canada. It seems likely either that Rook, which was first published by Parker Brothers in 1906, was  based on 200, or that the games had a common ancestor. 200 also has some similarity to a group of Chinese games known as Sheng Ji of which 100 is a typical example. However, it is hard to establish a convincing historical connection with the Chinese games, and the resemblance may be coincidental.\nThere are many variations. I will first describe what seems to be the standard form for four players in partnerships using 36 cards and playing to a target score of 200 (after which the game is named). Less serious players very often use 40 cards and play with a 4-card kitty. In the northern part of New Brunswick, the target score is often raised to 300 or 500 for a longer game. There are also versions for 2, 5 and 6 players.\nPlayers and Cards\n200 is generally agreed to be best for four players in partnerships - North and South play against East and West. In the variations section, versions for six, five and two players are described.\nFor the 4-player game without a kitty, a 36-card pack is created by removing all the 2\'s, 3\'s, 4\'s, 6\'s from a standard 52-card pack without jokers. The cards in each suit rank from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-5.\nWhen playing with a kitty, or with more than 4 players, more additional cards may be used - see variations.\nIn all forms of the game, the cards have point values as follows:\n\n\neach ace: 10 points   \n each ten: 10 points\n each five: 5 points\n other cards: 0 points\n\n\nso that there are 100 card points in the deck altogether.\nThe dealing, bidding and play are all clockwise.\nDeal\nThe first dealer is chosen at random. For example, a player can shuffle the deck and deal single cards face up to the players starting with the player on the left. The first player who receives a jack is the first dealer. After each hand, the turn to deal passes to the left. Before each deal, the cards are shuffled by the dealer and cut by the opponent to dealer\'s right. The dealer then deals 9 cards face down to each player, in batches of three, starting with the player to dealer\'s left.\nBidding\nPlayers now bid for the right to choose which suit will be trumps, each bid representing the number of points the bidder\'s partnership contracts to take in tricks if not outbid.\nThe player to the left of the dealer speaks first, and the bidding continues clockwise. The minimum bid is 50, all bids must be multiples of 5, and each bid must be higher than the last. A player who does not wish to bid can pass, but having passed cannot bid again in that auction.\nIf all four players pass, the hands are thrown in without score and the next dealer deals. If there is a bid, the bidding continues for as many circuits as necessary until three players have passed, or until somone bids 100, the highest possible bid.\nThe final (and highest) bidder becomes the contractor, and announces which suit will be trump for that hand.\nNote: it is not necessary for the first bidder to begin at the minimum 50 - the initial bid can be as high as you like.\nPlay\nHaving announced the trump suit, the contractor leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if able to. A player who has no card of the suit led is free to play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or, if it contains no trumps, by the highest card of the suit that was led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.\nThe objective is to win tricks that contain card points (Aces, 10\'s and 5\'s). Tricks without points have no value.\nIf the contractor fails to announce a trump suit before leading to the first trick, the suit of the first card played by the contractor automatically becomes trump.\nPlaying a trump when you have no card of the non-trump suit that was led is known as "cutting", no doubt from the French "couper", which means to trump in a card game, but also literally "to cut". There is no obligation to try to win the trick or to cut when you are unable to follow suit - it is legal to discard from another suit. Indeed if you expect your partner to win the trick you will probably want to discard a ten or five that might otherwise have been lost to the opponents.\nCompleted tricks are stored face down in front of a member of the team that won them and may not be looked at again by anyone until the end of the play.\nScoring\nScores are kept on paper. Each team begins with a score of zero.\nWhen all the cards have been played, each team counts the value of the point cards in their tricks. If the contractor\'s team has at least as many card points as the final bid, the total value of the cards in their tricks is added to their cumulative score. If the number of card points they took is less than the bid, the amount of the bid is subtracted from their cumulative score.\nThe opposing team add whatever card points they took in tricks to their cumulative score, with one exception: if the contractor\'s opponents currently have a cumulative score of 100 or more, then they can score for points in their tricks only if at least one member of their team bid during the auction. If they both passed at their first opportunity to speak, they score nothing for the points in their tricks.\nExample: Scores are NS:120, EW:100. NS bid 75.\n\nIf NS take 85 card points, their new score is 205 and they win the game.\nIf NS take 75 card points, their new score is 195. If East or West bid they score their 25 points for a cumulative score of 125; if they both just passed their score stays at 100.\nIf NS take 70 card points they lose the 75 they bid and their score is now 45. EW can score their 30 points provided that one of them bid for a total of 130; if both just passed their score stays at 100.\n\nA team\'s cumulative score can be negative. On the score sheet this is usually shown by drawing a box around the number - for example minus 95 is written as 95. The team is said to be "in the box", or sometimes "in the hole" (shown by a circle rather than a box around the score). Failing in a contract is sometimes known as being "boxed".\nThe first team to achieve a score of 200 points or more wins the game. If both teams reach 200 or more on the same deal then the bidding team wins.\nThe game also ends if one team reaches a negative score of 200 or worse while the other team\'s score is positive or zero. In that case the team with minus 200 or worse loses the game.\nVariations\nMany of these variations are extremely widespread, although some experts dislike those that increase the luck element of the game. Most informal games are played with a kitty and with the 100 for 200 bid. Allowing the dealer to keep the bid is also very common.\n200 with a Kitty\nProbably most non-tournament games of 200 are played with a kitty. The kitty is a face down packet of four cards that can be used by the contractor to improve his or her hand. This introduces an element of uncertainty and tends to lead to higher bids.\nIn this variant, a 40-card pack is used, including the sixes. Cards in each suit rank from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5. Nine cards are dealt to each player and four face card down to a central "kitty". The usual method of dealing is: a batch of three cards to each player; two to the kitty; three to each player; two to the kitty; three to each player.\nAfter the usual bidding process, the high bidder takes the four kitty cards without showing them and discards four cards face down in exchange before naming trumps. The cards discarded can include some or all of the cards obtained from the kitty. No one is allowed to look at these discarded cards until the end of the play - even the contractor cannot look at them after the first card has been led. The play the proceeds as usual, and any points in the discarded cards count for the contractor\'s opponents at the end of the play. Scoring is as usual.\nThere are several variations concerning the contractor\'s four-card discard and how it is counted.\n\nThe most usual rule, as given above, is that any cards can be discarded, no one can look at the discard, and that any points in it count to the contractor\'s opponents.\nSome play that any trumps that are discarded must be shown to the other players after trumps are announced and before the play begins.\nSome play that any points in the discard count for the side that wins the last trick.\nA few players award the points in the discard to the side that wins the first trick, but the discard still cannot be looked at until the end of the play.\nSome players do not allow any point cards (aces, tens or fives) to be discarded. This could rarely lead to an impossible situation if the contractor had 10 or more of the 12 point cards among the 13 cards held after picking up the kitty.\nSome players do not allow trumps or point cards to be discarded. There is a greater chance of this leading to an impossible situation, since there are now 19 cards that cannot be discarded, and it is quite conceivable that the contractor could hold 10 of these.\nSome players require the contractor to inform the other players if there are any point cards in the discard.\nSome count the discarded points for the contractor. This changes the tactics, allowing the contractor to save tens and fives simply by discarding them. Naturally this leads to higher bids.\n\n100 for 200\nThis bid, known as "cent pour deux cents" in French, or sometimes as "two for one", is allowed in most informal games. It is the highest bid, and commits the contractor\'s team to win all 100 points in tricks. They score 200 points if successful, thus winning the game unless they were in the hole (box) when they bid it. If a bid of 100 for 200 fails, the contractor\'s team loses just 100 points (and as usual the opponents score the points they make provided that either they have bid or their score is below 100).\n100 to win the game\nSome play that if the bidders take 100 points in their tricks, they win the whole game, irrespective of the bid or the previous scores. This is known as a bloutte, and gives its name to this version of the game. If a team takes 100 card points while losing one zero-point trick, this is known as a chienne (bitch), and winning 100 points while losing two empty tricks is a double chienne. The result is the same, but a chienne or double chienne is considered more embarassing for the losers.\nKeeping\nIn this widespread variation, the dealer is allowed to equal the highest bid so far, rather than bidding higher. The dealer would say "I keep the bid". Example: North deals, East passes, South bids 60, West bids 75, North "keeps" 75, East cannot bid, having already passed, South passes. If West passes now, North is the contractor and the bid is 75. Alternatively West might bid 80, and North would then have the option of "keeping" 80 or passing, and so on.\nWhen keeping is allowed, a bid of 100 (or 100 for 200) by a player other than the dealer does not automatically end the auction. The dealer still has the right to keep the 100 bid.\nOne correspondent describes an unusual variation of this where any player can keep (not just the dealer), but you cannot keep a bid that has already been kept. So the bidding might start: East "50", South "keep 50", West "55", North "keep 55", East "60", South "65", West "pass", North "pass", East "keep 65" and so on. West cannot keep 50 in the first round of bidding since 50 has already been kept by South; similarly East cannot keep 55.\nDealer must bid after three passes\nMany people do not allow all four players to pass. If the first three players pass the dealer is forced to become the contractor and bid 50. This rule is commonly found in 200 with a kitty, where after three passes, with the help of the kitty the dealer has good chances of success.\nSingle Round Bidding\nIn some groups each player only gets one chance to bid, the dealer speaking last. Those who play this variation usually allow the dealer to keep.\nWith single round bidding, some play that when the first three players pass, the declarer simply becomes the contractor, with the right to use the kitty if any and name trump, without bidding. In this case the contractor\'s team cannot lose points, though the opponents might score more than them. If the first two players pass, then in this variation the third player should bid if at all possible, to stop the dealer getting the contract for nothing.\nDenis Landry reports that in some parts of Qubec (near the Eastern Townships), the game is played under the name "Bloutte" (spelling uncertain) with single round bidding and a target score of 100 to win the game.\nTarget score of 300 or 500\nIn the northern part of New Brunswick, it is normal to play to a target score of 300 or 500 points to win the game, rather than 200.\nIn this case, the threshhold beyond which you are "required to bid" in order to score points against the contractor is set at 100 points below the target. The idea is that it should not be possible to win a game on a hand where your team did not bid in the auction.\n\nWhen the target is 300 points, you can score points without having bid only if your score at the start of the hand is 195 or less.\nWhen the target is 500 points, you can score points without having bid only if your score at the start of the hand is 395 or less.\n\nSome players require a team to have bid at least 60 to qualify for points when they are at or above the "required to bid" threshhold. A bid of just 50 or 55 does not qualify.\nThe amount you have to be "in the hole" (or box) to lose (provided that the other team is not also in the hole) is normally set equal to the target. For example with a target of 500, if one team goes 500 points \'in the hole\', the other team wins, if their score is 0 or higher.\nSome play that you need 500 to win the game, but you lose if you are 300 in the hole. No doubt there are many other local variations on these target numbers.\nOther scoring variations\nSome play that if both teams reach the target score on the same deal, the team with the higher score wins - not the bidding team. It\'s unclear what happens in this version if the scores are equal - for example 210:210. Perhaps another deal is played to decide the winners.\nSome play that the game can only be won by winning a bid. So if a hand results in the contractor\'s opponents reaching 200 or more while the contractor\'s team is still below 200 after adding the score for their successful bid, the game is not over - further hands must be played. The game ends only when a contractor\'s bid is successful AND after scoring the contractor\'s team have a cumulative score of 200 or more.\nSome play that if a team wins while the other team is in the hole (below zero), this is considered a skunk - equivalent to winning two games. Others use the term skunk for the case where the losers neither won nor lost any points, so the game is won in two deals, 200 to zero.\nIn place of the rule that a team that is within 100 of the target if a target score cannot score points unless they bid, some play the following version. A team that is within 50 (or other agreed amount) of the target score cannot score unless they actually win the bidding and play the contract or defeat (box) the contractor. This makes it impossible for both teams to reach or pass the target in the same deal.\nNumber of cards\nSome play with hands of 10 cards each - so all the cards down to 5 are used for the game without a kitty, and if playing with a kitty the 4\'s are included as well. Denis Landry reports that the 10-card game (without a kitty) is more usual in South-East New Brunswick. In North-East New Brunswick, 200 is usually played with 9-card hands.\nAnother rarely played version is with 12-card hands and a kitty, using a full 52-card deck for four players.\nMinimum bid\nWhen playing variations that are favourable to the contractor, such as 200 with a kitty, some set the minimum bid higher, for example at 65 or higher.\nOn the other hand, the game \'Le Ruff\' as described in Richard Raymond\'s book, there is no minimum bid, though it is said that bids below 35 are unusual. If the first  three players pass, the dealer simply becomes the contractor and chooses trumps, with no minimum points requirement.\nNo Trump Contract\nSome allow the bidder to announce a no trump (sans atout) game in which there is no trump suit. No trump games score double: the bidding team score twice the number of points they took if they are successful and lose twice the amount bid if they fail. Their opponents score twice the value of the cards in the tricks that they take.\nCompulsory trump lead\nSome play that the first card led by the contractor determines the trump suit, and thus do not allow a non-trump to be led to the first trick.\nDeal variations and Misdeal\nSome prefer to deal the cards one or two at a time. Some deal cards in a single batch, nine at a time.\nWhen playing with a kitty, some deal the four kitty cards singly at any points during the deal.\nAs in many other card games, some like to play with a rule that a player who has been dealt no aces or face cards (i.e. no card above a 10) can call a "misdeal".  The cards are thrown in, shuffled and cut again and the same dealer deals again.\nLe Rough\nThis variant from Quebec is played with a kitty but using only 36 cards: each player is dealt eight cards (4 at a time) and there is a four card kitty (mise), dealt in two cards at a time or all at once at any time during the deal. The minimum bid is 70 and the dealer is allowed to keep (garder) the bid. The bidder takes the kitty and may discard any four cards, which count for the bidder\'s team. The bidder\'s first lead determines the trump suit unless the bidder announces "sans atout" in which case the hand is played without trumps.\nThe target score is 350 points. If the bidder\'s team does not have a negative score, the bidder may, before taking the kitty, announce that the bidder\'s team will win all 100 card points. In this case, if they succeed they win the whole game, but if they lose the other team wins.\nSome play that if the first three players pass, the dealer must also pass. This puts pressure in the dealer\'s partner to bid at least 70, so that the dealer will not be forced to pass with a good hand.\nSix-player game\nSix players can play as two teams of three, sitting alternately, or as three teams of two, with partners facing each other. Using the normal 36-card pack each player is dealt 6 cards; if playing with a kitty 40 cards are used. Alternatively, a 6-player game with kitty can be played with the full 52-card pack, dealing 8 cards to each player. The "misdeal" rule is not be used with six players, since cards without aces or face cards are more frequent.\nThe bidding, play and scoring work the same way as in the four-player game.\nIn the game between three pairs, if a team loses by reaching the lower threshhold (minus 200 points in the 200-point game) while at least one other team has a zero or positive score, the losing team drops out while the other two teams keep their scores and continue playing a four-player game to determine the winners.\n200 with a Pot\nThis variation of the six-player game is played between three teams of two, using 40 cards, with 6 cards dealt to each player and a kitty of 4 cards.\n\nAt the start of the game, everyone pays the agreed ante (say one dollar) into a pot. \nIf the contracting team does not succeed their bid, each member of that team puts 50 cents (or whatever is decided) into the pot.  \nIf a bid suceeds, nobody pays, with one exception: if a team takes all 100 points in tricks (even if the bid is lower than 100), then everyone else puts in the cost of a lost bid (50 cents or whatever was decided).\nIf a hand is thrown in, all players passing, then each member of the dealer\'s team pays the cost of a lost bid (50 cents or whatever was decided).\n\nThe team that wins the game (500 points) divides the pot between them.\nFive-player Game\nI have been told that a five-player game exists using 40 cards (down to the 5). Each player is dealt 8 cards and there is no kitty. One player is a "silent partner" and plays as the partner of the winner of the bidding, the other four players bidding against each other.\nI do not know how the silent partner is chosen. The description I have says that this player has no team or score, and does not shuffle, deal or bid, which would suggest that the same player is dummy for the whole game. It would be fairer to rotate the partner with the deal - for example the player to dealer\'s right could be the silent partner (dummy).\nFor a more interesting five-player game I would suggest the following format. All players take part in the bidding, and the winning bidder calls a card whose holder will be the contractor\'s partner for that hand only. The partner does not announce who he or she is - this will become clear when the called card appears in the course of play. Each player\'s score is kept individually, the holder of the called card scoring the same as the contractor, and the other three players all scoring the points taken by their temporary team. This five-player format is successfully used in several other games, but I have not yet heard of it being used for 200.\nCutthroat 200\nIt is possible to play 200 without partners. The contractor plays alone against all the other players. Presumably each individual player scores the points taken in tricks, except that a contractor with insufficient points loses the amount of the bid. If playing this without a kitty, the minimum bid should perhaps be lowered.\nTwo Players\nUsing a 36-card pack, each player has a 9-card hand, and a "silent partner" whose cards are dealt in three stacks of three: two cards face down with a face-up card on top. \nThe game proceeds like the four-player game. The silent partners cannot bid, and when it is a silent partner\'s turn to play, the live partner plays one of the silent partner\'s face-up cards and turns the next card of the stack face up when the trick is complete. Like the live players, the silent partners must follow suit if possible, taking account only of the visible cards.\nTactics\nBidding\nA good hand for bidding is one with aces or other high cards, preferably in sequence, and with an unbalanced distribution including one or two long suits. Point cards other than aces are a liability.\nWhen the non-dealer\'s team is within 100 of the target, the first player will normally start with a low bid even with weak cards to make sure they can score their tricks if the dealer\'s team wins the bidding. Since a bid of 50 might be made purely for this tactical reason, the first player will probably start with at least 55 if holding genuine values, to let partner know that the bid was based on some strength.\nIf the dealer\'s team is within 100 of the target, the first player will often open with a high bid, to try to shut out the dealer\'s team or tempt them to bid too high.\nKitty\nWhen playing with a kitty, the kitty may improve the contractor\'s hand, but may sometimes make it worse. Best are aces or other high cards, or cards of your long suit. Worst are point cards, especially in your short suits - these can ruin an otherwise good hand.\nWhen discarding, the contractor will try to throw cards in weak, short suits, if possible getting rid of one or two suits entirely, so that the opponents\' aces in those suits can be cut.\nPlay\nAs in any trick-taking game, players should try to keep track of the cards that have been played, especially trumps, high cards and point cards. The winning bidder usually makes the last few tricks (he usually ends up with a trump or two). Knowing the exact trump position can greatly simplify your play. If you\'re with this player and know how many trumps he has, you know how and when you can save your points. This is even more important if he\'s not in your team. If you know how many trumps your oppenent has, you\'ll know if and when you should gamble your point cards.\nThe person who won the bid likely has the most trump cards. Therefore, the contractor\'s team will usually start by trying to draw all the opponents\' trump cards by repeatedly leading trumps. There are a few exceptions. For example if your partner won the bid and you can trump a suit, you may want to keep back your trump cards rather than leading them and hope to cut (trumpo) an opponent\'s ace. Later in the hand the contractor\'s partner should try to win tricks that will enable the contractor to dispose safely of endangered point cards in non-trump suits.\nAs in any partnership game, you should help your partner. For example when partner is winning the trick, you can throw a count card that might otherwise have been lost, but usually not an ace, since it might win a trick later. If your partner won the bid and you know he can cut (trump) a given suit, by all means lead that suit. He will be able to get rid of his unwanted cards (or cut if there are points in the trick).\nIf your team didn\'t win the bid, play your non-trump aces as soon as possible. Many players are tempted to keep their aces instead of playing them on a trick with no other points. This is a big gamble that should only be taken under exceptionnal circumstances. The reverse is true if your team won the bid and all of your opponents\' trump cards have been played - now you can keep aces to capture other point cards. However, you should be careful, especially if your partner won the bid. Everyone will know you have that ace and your partner may not have another card of that suit to lead to it, in which case you risk that the suit will never be led again and you will have to throw your ace on an opponent\'s trick at the end.\nIf the opposing team won the contract, play suits that havn\'t been played yet. You want your partner to play his aces and minimise the risk of being cut. Also, if there are aces left in play and your partner is the only player who hasn\'t led to a trick, there\'s a good chance that he\'s got that ace. Therefore is a good idea to lead a point card of that suit, especially if you have several point cards - you\'re not going to save them all, so you might as well try it.\nIf your team won the bid, you usually want to stay clear of leading a suit that hasn\'t been played yet (unless you have the ace, of course). Instead, try to make it so that either you or your partner can cut suits that havn\'t been played (because the ace of that suit is probably in your opponent\'s hand). If you must lead a suit that hasn\'t been played yet, play a suit in which you have a protected 10. This way, your opponents can\'t score so many points in that trick.\nIf you only have K-5 (or even K-10) of a given suit, you should almost always lead the 5 (or 10). You were probably going to lose it anyway, and this way, you will probably win the second trick in that suit.\nOther 200 web pages\nOn Facebook, Amlie Aubut has published the rules of Le Dix in Acadian French.\nThe Ange Hereux site has rules in French for Le Rough.\nHere is a version of La Barouche described in English by Stella Johnson and Francis Fisher.\n\nThis page is mainly based on information contributed by: Tony Bleyer, Martin Bourgeois, Andre Caissie, Claude Foley, Ann Fulton, John Furlong, Paul Gareau, Serge Guilbert, Denis Landry, Clarence Lavertu, Chris Leblanc, Dax Oliver and Cleo Saulnier.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > King-Ten-Five group > Two Hundred\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2006, 2012, 2013, 2014.

The idea of all these games is that you try to get rid of all your cards by playing them face down according to some rule. If anyone thinks you have broken the rule they can challenge. After a challenge the last play is exposed and whoever was in the wrong has to pick up the played cards. \n\nThe version of "I Doubt It" most often found in card game books has each player playing the next rank above or below the previous play. The rules of that version are given on the Bullshit page.\n\nThe game described on this page, known as I Doubt It, or IDI for short, players must all (pretend to) play the same rank of card until someone challenges. It is somewhat similar to the Russian game Verish\' ne Verish\' (Trust - Don\'t Trust). Although it is a children\'s game, the strategy is very interesting and can get quite convoluted. \n\n\nAnother, more elaborate game in which the cards are played face down and challenged is the Finnish game Valepaska.\n\nPlayers, Cards and Objective\n\nThere can be three or more players - probably no more than six. It is possible for two to play, but then the force variation must be played. A standard pack is used, with no jokers. An equal number of cards (five or more) is dealt to each player\'s hand.  Each player must keep the number of cards that they own clearly visible at all times.\n\nThe objective is to get rid of all the cards in your hand.\n\nPlay\n\nOne player, designated as the lead, begins a round by playing a single card face down, starting a stack in the center of the table, and announcing a rank - such as "queen", "seven", "ace", etc. Suit doesn\'t matter - just rank.  The card played may or may not actually match the announced rank, but no one knows for sure except the person who played it.\n\nGoing clockwise, each player then takes a turn consisting of one of two options: \n\nPass without playing a card. \nPlay a single card face down on the stack. The played card is claimed to match the rank announced by the lead, but in fact the card may or may not match this rank.  Note that the rank announced by the lead must be followed until the round is over.\n\n\nThe play continues around the table as many times as necessary until everyone passes or there is a challenge. Note that if all the other players pass, it is perfectly legal (and very common) for one player to repeatedly add cards to the stack.\n\nEnding a round\n\nThe round can end in two ways.\n\n1. All players pass\nIf all players pass, the cards in the stack are removed from play, without being revealed.  The last player who played a card on the stack takes the lead in a new round and new stack (possibly \nannouncing a different rank).2. Challenge\nAfter any play, and before another card is played on the stack, the player of the last card may be challenged by any other player - you do not have to wait for your turn to challenge.  The challenging player is the first who touches the stack and declares "Doubt". The top card of the stack is then revealed.  If it is something other than the rank announced by the lead, then the person who played it must pick up the stack.  The challenging player then has the lead.  If the played card matches the rank announced by the lead, then it\'s the challenged player who gets the lead and the challenger who must pick up the stack.\n\nEnding the Game\n\nWhen the player whose turn it is to play has just one card, and that card is the correct rank to match the lead (or if it is that player\'s turn to lead to a new stack), the player wins the game.\n\n\nVariations\nBluff\nSandipan Tarafdar describes a variant called Bluff played in West Bengal. The rules are the same as above, except that a player may play more than one card in a turn, declaring all the played cards to be of the currently required rank. When starting a new round a player choose any rank and play any number of cards declaring them all to be of that rank - for example three sevens. A player who wishes to challenge does so by saying "Bluff".\nShruti Raghavan reports that Bluff is sometimes played with a pack including jokers. In this case the jokers are wild and are always the truth, no matter what rank is supposed to be played.\nIn Bluff, a player who has passed is not allowed to put down cards again in that round, though they are still allowed to challenge.\nRather than ending as soon as the first player has run out of cards, the play may be continued until only one player has cards left. In this case the first player who ran out of cards wins, the next takes second place, and so on, with the last player holding cards as the loser.\nTactics. It is an advantage to start rounds, as the player who does so can choose what rank to play.  If a player has many cards of a certian rank, he or she should choose that rank for that round. An often used strategy is to lie about your cards the first time you play them and tell the truth the second or third time.  This way, your opponents have no idea whether or not you\'re telling the truth.\nForce\n\nHwei Yin invented the "force" option to make two-player games possible.  This variation makes the pace slower and more intense, and, although still hilarious, "force" strategies may get too subtle for young children.\n\nWhen playing this variation there are two ways of challenging. The challenger must say either "doubt" or "force". If the challenger says "doubt" the challenge is resolved as explained above. If the challenger says "force", the person whose play was challenged must produce from his hand a card whose rank matches the announced rank of the lead.  If such a card is produced, then the challenger must pick up both that card and the stack, and the challenged player leads the next round. If the challenged player fails to produce such a card, he must pick up the stack and the challenger leads.\n\nA player who has just played his last card may be "doubted" but cannot be "forced".\n\nBasic observations on tactics\n\nThe key to winning (with or without the "force" variation) is getting the lead and setting the rank to your preference.  This is done by winning challenges or ensuring that your card is the last played on the stack.\n\nEventually one person tends to collect all cards of a given rank. This is especially dangerous in the basic game: if this person gets the lead, she knows that everyone else must pass, so it\'s easier for her to sneak junk in as she dumps several cards uninterrupted.\n\nThe essential quandary for "forcing" comes when you have only one card that matches the lead.  If you play it, then someone can "force" you and you\'ll lose the challenge.  If you lie and play something else then you are safe from a force, but you might be doubted instead.  After being stung with a few forces, people often don\'t have the guts to play at all with only one matching card.\n\nLike all bluffing games, IDI essentially becomes a game of pattern recognition.  The player who wins exploits patterns in her opponent\'s play before they can adjust.  Thus, a bad player can hand the game to the same person every time by repeatedly challenging her and losing.  This also means that two player games are very intense, as each player has only one other personality to concentrate on.\n\nOther WWW pages\nHere is David Zechiel\'s "Tierney family version" of I Doubt It, known as Liars Poker, though it is an entirely different game from the Liars Poker (Poker Menteur) on pagat.com.\nAnother description of this game, rejoicing in the name "Fourshit", can be found on Khopesh\'s Bullshit page.\nCalvin Yoshitake has developed a variation Cal\'s BS in which the play is in any order rather than in turn and two jokers are added to the deck.\nOn this site, there are pages on the very similar Russian game Verish\' ne verish\' and the related game Bullshit, in which the rank of cards played changes by one on each turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Beating Games > I Doubt It\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod 1998, 2013.

It has been known by a number of similar names, such as Bock or Bocken in Germany and Bog or Poque in France. The current Icelandic version Pkk is described on another page of this site. Variations of Poch are played in North America under the names Tripoli and Three in One, and boards are sold there under various proprietary names: Tripoley, Rummoli, Michigan Rummy, etc. A detailed early history of the game can be found in an article by Thierry Depaulis: "Pochspiel: An \'International\' Card Game of the 15th Century", published in The Playing-Card (Journal of the International Playing-Card Society) in three parts, in Vol XIX No 2 (Nov 1990), Vol XIX No 3 (Feb 1991) and Vol XIX No 4 (May 1991).\nOn this page the modern German form of Poch is described first, based on rules supplied with a modern board, on various books, and on information from Jan Bttcher. There follow summaries of differences in the 18th and 19th century versions of the game.\nPlayers and Equipment\nFrom 3 to 6 players can take part and a 32-card pack is used, the cards ranking from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7. Each player has an equal supply of chips. A board (Pochbrett) in the centre of the table is used to hold chips staked to the the various pools until they are won. There are many designs of Poch board - here is a modern example:\n\nIf a ready-made board is not to hand it is fairly easy to make your own. You need places for the nine pools: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Marriage (marked King-Queen on the board), Sequence (marked 7-8-9 on the board), Pocher (marked with a Joker on the board) and the centre pot (unlabelled).\nStake and Deal\nThe first dealer is chosen at random and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. Before each deal, every player must put one chip into each of the nine pools.\nThe dealer deals out the cards clockwise, one at a time, and places the last card face up on the table. Unless there are three players. Some of the players will have one more card than others: this does not matter. The last card belongs to no one; the suit of this card is the "pay suit".\nThe Play\nFirst Stage\nThe players who hold the Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten of the pay suit collect the chips from the relevant pools. If one player holds the King and Queen of the pay suit, that player takes the marriage pool. If one player holds the Seven, Eight and Nine or the pay suit, that player takes the contents of the sequence pool.\nIn many deals no one wins the Marriage or Sequence pools. In this case the chips remain in the pool, and players will continue to add further chips before each deal even though they are not empty. If an Ace, King, Queen, Jack or Ten is turned up by the dealer as the pay suit card, then no one wins the pool corresponding to that card, and it is carried over to the next deal and added to in the same way.\nSecond Stage\nIn this stage, players bet on who has the best set of cards of the same rank. The betting process is known as Pochen. Any set of four of a kind beats any set of three of a kind, and any three of a kind beats any pair. A set of higher ranking cards beats a set of the same number of lower ranking cards. If two players have pairs of the same rank, the pair containing the card of the pay suit is better. Example: 8-8-8-8 beats K-K-K, which beats 9-9-9, which beats Q-Q, which beats Q-Q if diamonds or hearts is the pay suit.\nNote that the only combinations that are allowed here are pairs, triples and fours of a kind, and only the best combination of each player is compared. If you have two pairs you only count the higher one. If you have a triple and a pair your hand just counts as a triple (there is no such thing as a "full house" in this game). If all your cards are different ranks, you are not allowed to take part in the Pochen at all.\nStarting with the player to the left of the dealer and going round clockwise., players can pass if the cannot or do not wish to bet, or can bet 1 or more chips that they have the best hand. To bet you say "Ich poche 1" or "Ich poche 3" or whatever amount you want to bet, placing that number of chips towards the centre of the table. Subsequent players can either match your bet, raise the bet by staking a larger number of chips, or drop out (fold). The betting continues around the table for as many circuits as necessary until the amounts bet by the players who have stayed in are equal. (When you drop out of the betting you sacrifice any chips you may already have bet on an earlier round.)\nWhen the bets are equal, each of the players who has stayed in shows the combination (pair, triple or quartet) on which they were betting, and the owner of the best combination takes all the chips that were bet and the contents of the Pochen pool.\nIf everyone passes, the contents of the Pochen pool stay there and are added to before the next deal.\nIf only one player bets, or if all players but one drop out during the betting, then the only bettor naturally takes the Pochen pool and all the stakes, having shown a pair or better to prove entitlement to win them.\nI have not seen explicit rules about betting limits or what happens when players do not have enough chips to equal another player\'s bet. Since Poch is nowadays usually played as a family game with no money at stake, this probably does not matter much. If it were played for money, it would be sensible to have a system similar to Poker, where if you do not have enough chips to equal the last bet you can stake all your remaining chips. At the end of the betting you will have a showdown against everyone who has bet at least as much as you, but if you win you only get from each of them an amount equal to your stake; you would also get the contents of the Pochen pool. The players who bet more will have a showdown against each other and the best of their hands will win the remaining parts of their stakes.\nThird Stage\nThe winner of the Pochen (or the player to dealer\'s left if everyone passed) begins the play and can play any card from their hand face up in the centre (on top of the centre pot on the board). Whoever holds the next higher card of the same suit plays it, and this continues until a point is reached where no one has the next card (because it has already been played or because it was the face up pay suit card).\nThe person who played the last and highest card of the sequence begins again, playing any card, and again the cards are played in ascending sequence in suit. This continues until a player runs out of cards.\nThe player who first plays their last card is the winner of the third stage. This player collects the contents of the centre pot, and in addition is paid by each of the other players one chip for each card they still have in their hands.\nEnding the Game\nThe game usually continues until someone runs out of chips. Often this will happen when someone does not have the necessary 9 chips to place on the board when the cards are dealt. The remaining players then count their chips and the winner is the player with most chips. Any unclaimed chips on the board remain there and are not won by anybody. Often there will be unclaimed ships in the Sequence and Marriage pools.\nVariations\nSome play that if the dealer turns up an Ace, King, Queen, Jack or Ten as the centre card, the dealer takes the corresponding pool. In that case, these pools are always won by somebody.\nSome play that the card turned up to determine the pay suit belongs to the player whose turn it is to receive a card in the normal dealing order.\nSome play that it is possible to take part in the Pochen without even a pair of matching cards. If none of the players in the showdown has even a pair, the highest single card wins. In this case it is usual to use Skat order of suits - clubs (high), spades, hearts, diamonds (low) - to break single ties, and between tied pairs the pair containing the club is higher, irrespective of the pay suit.\nIt would be possible to play for money, giving a value to each chip. In this case, at the end of the game any unclaimed chips on the board should be distributed as equally as possible to the players, and everyone then receives or pays money according to the number of chips they have more or less than their initial supply.\nLe Poque in the late 18th century\nThe following summary is based on the rules of Le Poque in the Acadmie Universelle des Jeux, Amsterdam, 1789.\n\nThe differences from the modern German game are as follows.\n\n\nLe Poque is played with a 36-card pack, including sixes, when there are more than four players; three or four players use the 32-card pack as above.\nThe Poque board has only six pools: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Poque.\nAt one point it is stated that the fifth pool is labelled with a Ten and a Nine, which suggests that both cards of the pay suit might be required to win it, but this is contradicted elsewhere in the text.\nLe Poque is dealt and played counter-clockwise; the first bet in the second stage was made by the player to dealer\'s right.\nOnly five cards are dealt to each player: two at a time and then three at a time. The dealer then turns the next card face up to determine the pay suit. The remaining cards are left in a face down stack and not used, with the result that the play in the third stage is often interrupted when the next card required is in the undealt portion of the pack.\nThe dealer takes the relevant pool if the card turned to indicate the pay suit is an Ace, King, Queen, Jack or Ten.\nThe betting stage takes place before the players who hold pay suit cards corresponding to the pools collect their winnings. The poque pot is won by the player who has the best hand in the showdown as usual. If all but one player drops out, the surviving player can win the pot even without a pair.\nThere is no pool for the third stage, in which the cards are played out in suit and sequence as in the modern game. The player who runs out of cards first collects from all the others a number of chips equal to the cards in their hands as usual. In addition, the player who has most cards has to pay this number of chips to each opponent. It is unclear what happens if two players tie for most cards - perhaps they share the payment.\n\nPoch in the 19th century\nThe following description, contributed by David Parlett, is based on Hoffmann: Der Meister in Allen Kartenspielen (Hamburg 1873, first edition 1810).\nPhase 1. From three to six players each put an agreed stake into each of the first seven of eight compartments labelled Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Marriage, Sequence, and Poch. Five cards each are dealt from a 32- or 52-card pack and the next is turned for trump. Anyone dealt the trump Ace wins the stake on Ace, and so for the other compartments. The marriage stake is won by anyone dealt both King and Queen of trumps, in addition to those of the separate King and Queen pool, and that of sequence similarly for holding the 7-8-9 of trumps. Any stake not so won is carried forward to the next deal.\nPhase 2. The stake for poch is then contested by vying as to who holds the best combination, for which purpose a quartet beats a triplet, a triplet a pair, and a pair an unpaired hand, the highest card settling ties. Each in turn may bet or fold. The first to bet does so by placing any stake in the compartment labelled poch and announcing Ich poche eins (I bet one, or however many). Each of those who have not folded may at their turn either fold, stay, or raise. At a showdown the best hand wins the poch, but precise details of the vying procedure are ambiguous.\nPhase 3. Finally, cards are played out in sequences in suit after the manner of Stops games (Newmarket, Michigan, etc.). A player ending a sequence is paid by the others and starts a new one, and the first out of cards wins one for each card left unplayed in all the others hands.\nNote: Stops games did not appear before the 16th century, and in the earliest form of Pochen the final stake was won by whoever most nearly reached a count of 31.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Matching games > Stops group > Poch\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2005.

Club of America. I have added some common variations.\n\nIntroduction\nPlayers and CardsSequence of Hands\nObject of the Game\nDeal\nBidding\nPlay\nScoring\nVariations\nRelated Games\nOther Oh Hell WWW Pages\n\nSoftware, Online Games, Score Sheets and Scoring Applications\n\nIntroduction\nThis game, in which players try to predict the exact number of tricks they will win, first appeared in London and New York in the 1930\'s and has since become popular in many parts of the world. Its original name Oh Hell! evidently offended some people and has been bowdlerised in many books to Oh Pshaw! or Oh Well!, while others  have preferred more robust alternatives such as Oh Shit! Some call it Blob or Blackout, perhaps because of the practice of recording a player\'s bid on the scoresheet and then obliterating it with a black blob if the player failed to take the predicted number of tricks. Traditionally the size of the players\' hands increases or decreases by one in each deal, and this has given rise to the names Elevator (l\'Ascenseur in France), Up and Down the River (in Australia and New Zealand) and 10 op en neer in the Netherlands. In Britain it is often known as Nomination Whist, a name which also sometimes refers to different games. Other names include Bust (in Australia and New Zealand), Boerenbridge (in the Netherlands), Kachuful (in India) and German Bridge (in Hong Kong).\nPlayers and Cards\n\nFrom 3 to 7 people can play. The game is best when played with 4 to 6.\n\n\n\n  A standard 52 card deck is used. The cards in each suit rank (from high to low) A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.\n  \nSequence of Hands\n\nThe game consists of a series of hands. The first hand is played with 7 to 10 cards dealt to each player, depending on the number of players:\n\n3 to 5 players, 10 cards each;\n6 players, 8 cards each;\n7 players, 7 cards each\n\n(because of the limit of 52 cards available). Each successive hand is played with one card fewer, down to a hand of just one card each, then one card more per hand back up to the starting level. \n\nExample: With 7 players, the hands are: 7 cards, then 6,5,4,3,2,1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7, for a total of 13 hands to the game. A game should take approximately 45 minutes.\n\nObject of the Game\n\nThe object is for each player to bid the number of tricks he thinks he can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many; no more and no fewer. Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly, and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or under (see scoring below).\n\nThe hook is that at least one player will fail on each hand, because the total number of tricks bid by the players may not equal the number of tricks available on that hand.\n\nDeal\n\nTo determine the first dealer, draw cards. The player with the highest card deals first. The turn to deal rotates clockwise with each hand.\n\nThe cards are shuffled and cut and the dealer deals the cards singly until everyone has the appropriate number of cards for the hand being played. The next card is turned face up and the suit of this card is the trump suit for the hand. The trump suit beats any of the other three suits played in that hand. The remaining undealt cards are placed in a face down stack with the turned trump on top of it.\n\nBidding\n\nThe bidding in each hand begins with the player to the left of the dealer, then continues clockwise, back around to the dealer, who bids last. Each bid is a number representing the number of tricks that player will try to take. Everyone must bid - it is not possible to pass, but you can bid zero, in which case your object is to take no tricks at all. A bid may be changed only if the next player to the left has not yet bid. Remember the hook: the dealer may not bid the number that would cause the total number of tricks bid to equal the number of tricks available; a hand will always be "over-bid" or "under-bid". Keep in mind when bidding that not all cards in the deck are in play in any hand.\n\nPlay\n\nThe play begins with the player to the dealer\'s left, who leads the first card. The lead may be any suit (including trump). Play follows clockwise. Each player must follow the suit led, if he can. If not, he may play any other card in his hand, including trump. The player who has played the highest trump card, or if no trump was played, the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick. That player then leads to the next trick. Continue until all tricks have been played and won.\n\nScoring\n\nThe scorekeeper is designated prior to each game according to house rules. The scorekeeper, needless to say, has a distinct advantage, and should be monitored closely for "inadvertent" errors. The designated scorekeeper notes each bid and resulting scores on a score sheet. There are many different ways to score Oh Hell!\n\n\nIn the simplest version, a player who wins the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the number of tricks bid (10 points for zero tricks, 11 for 1 trick, 12 for two tricks, etc.) Players who take more or fewer tricks than they bid score nothing. This method has the advantage that the scorekeeper, having written down the bids at the start of the play, can simply write a figure "1" in front of those that were successful and delete those that are not. The game with this scoring method is often known as Blackout or Blob, because the scorer obliterates or blacks out unsuccessful bids, so that they become black blobs on the score sheet. \n\nPerhaps the most widespread scoring method is to award 1 point for each trick won plus a bonus of 10 points for players who win exactly the number of tricks they bid. So for example a player who bid 2 would score 12 points for winning exactly 2 tricks, but only 1 for 1 trick and 3 for 3 tricks. This gives a player whose bid fails a slight incentive to win as many tricks as possible.\n\nSome other scoring methods are given in the variations section below. Whatever method is used, the score keeper keeps a cumulative total of each player\'s score. The final cumulative scores determine the result. If the game is played for money, players pay or receive amounts corresponding to the difference of their scores from the average.\n\n\nSeveral people have produced preprinted Oh Hell score sheets and applications, reflecting various scoring methods. \nVariations\nSequence of Hands\n\nThere are a lot of variations of this. Some people start from 1 card each, go up to the maximum number of cards and then back down to 1. Some just go from the maximum down to 1 and then stop, or vice versa. If there are four people the maximum number of cards dealt may be 13 rather than 10, with three people you can go up to 17. Some people go up to some other maximum, such as 7 cards, irrespective of the number of players.\n\nDan Strohm describes a version, called Devil\'s Bridge, in which the hand size increases and then decreases. On the final 1 card hand, the players must each hold their card on their forehead, so each player can see all the other player\'s cards but not their own.\n\n\nBryce Francis reports that in Australia, when playing Bust with 5 players, they add 13 low cards from a second pack to make a 65 card pack, so as to deal 13 cards each on the first hand as with 4 players. When there are six players they add a further 13 low cards, so that the bottom half of the pack is duplicated. If duplicate cards are played to a trick, the second played beats the first.\n\nA 3-player game is also possible, removing 13 low cards from a single pack.Determining Trumps\n\nSome sequences include hands in which all cards are dealt (for example 13 cards each to 4 players). There is of course then no card left to determine the trump suit. These hands are played without trumps. Some play the largest deals without trumps even if not all the cards are used.\n\nInstead of turning up a card, some people go through the possible trump suits in a fixed sequence. This sequence may or may not include "no trumps".\n\nIn the Indian (Gujurati) game Kachuful, the sequence of trump suits is spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts and the name of the game, which literally means \'raw flower\', is also a mnemonic for this sequence: Ka = Kari = Spades,\nChu = Chukat = Diamonds, \nFu = Falli = Clubs, L = Lal = Hearts\n\n  Brad Wilson describes a version called "Oh Shit!" in which Spades are always trumps.\n\nJean-Pierre Coulon reports a variation in which after the appropriate number of cards have been dealt to the players, the next card is turned face up. If the rank of the turned up card is from 2 to 6, there are no trumps for the deal; if it is 7 or higher, the suit of the turned up card is trumps.\n\nBidding\n\nSome people play without the hook rule, so the dealer is allowed to bid in such a way that everyone can win. There was a lively discussion in rec.games.playing-cards as to which version is more skilful, with strong advocates of each. Some think that hands where the bids add up are too easy; but others say that forcing the bids not to add up removes a tactical option from the dealer.\n\nSome play with simultaneous bidding. When the players are ready to bid, they put a fist on the table.  When everyone\'s fist is out, the group says "One, Two, Three" while bouncing their fists on the table. On Three, everyone must stick out some number of fingers (possibly zero) to indicate how many tricks they will try to take. Of course, with this method, there\'s no restriction against the total number of bid tricks being equal to the number of cards dealt. Since players cannot adjust their bids based on the other players\' bids, the total tricks bid can be wildly different from the tricks available - for example it is not uncommon for three or four players to bid "one" when only one card was dealt. Several correspondents report that in Australia, most groups use simultaneous bidding rather than bidding in turn.\n\nPlay\nSome play that the dealer, rather than the player to dealer\'s left, leads to the first trick.\nDavid Wuori (of Maine, USA) reports a variation in which a player who has no card of the suit led must trump. Only if you have no cards of the suit led and no trumps can you discard from a different non-trump suit. Although this is rule is uncommon in English speaking countries, it is actually the usual way of playing La Podrida (the Spanish equivalent to Oh Hell played in Latin America and in Spain) as well as the equivalent Romanian game of Whist.\nMark Brader suggests a variation in which two jokers are included, to make a 54-card deck. These jokers are a suit of their own containing just two equal cards. If a joker is led it wins the trick unless trumped. If a joker is turned up the other joker is the only trump. \nDick Atkinson reports a version of Blackout for 5 or 6 players, played in Northeast England in the 1970s. Two jokers are added to the pack, and if there are 5 players the four deuces are removed leaving 50 cards. With 5 players the deal is always 10 cards each and with 6 players 9 cards each. The trump suit rotates from deal to deal in the order hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades. The dealer could not make the bid total equal the number of cards dealt. Jokers could not be led (unless the player had no other cards) and could not be played in  the first trick. Apart from that, a joker could be played to any trick (even if the player could have followed suit). The first player of a joker could nominate it as either "high", automatically winning the trick or "low", automatically losing. The player of the second joker had no choice: it would be low if the first joker was high and high if the first was low. If a player was forced to lead a joker, the first suited card played determined the suit of the trick.\nScoring\n\nThere are many alternative systems.\n\nSome players give the usual 10-point bonus for a successful positive bid but award only 5 points for a successful bid of zero. Others award 5 plus the number of cards dealt to each player for a successful zero bid, recognising the fact that zero is more difficult when more cards are dealt.\nSome score 10 points for each trick bid and won for a successful bid. A successful "zero" bid wins 10 points. A player whose bid is unsuccessful (over or under) loses 10 points times the difference between the number of tricks won and the number of tricks bid.\nAnother system is that you win 5 points if you are right plus 10 for each trick taken, and you lose 5 points if you are wrong plus an extra 5 for each trick difference from your bid.\nYet another system: if you make your bid exactly you score 10 points plus the square of the number of tricks you bid (i.e. 10 points for none, 11 for one, 14 for two, 19 for three, 26 for four, etc.); if you fail you lose the square of the difference between the number of tricks you bid and the number of tricks you took.\nSome play for a single winner, who is the player with the highest score when the whole series of hands has been played. In case of a tie after the last hand, some deal further hand(s) with the maximum number of cards until a clear winner is determined. The winner may not be any of those involved in the original tie - any player can win until the end.\n\nMore variations\nThe Oh Hell Variations page in the Invented Games section of this site has a collection of Oh Hell variations contributed by readers.\nA version of Oh Hell! under the Dutch name Boerenbridge was formerly available to play against three computer opponents at  Kaartspellen online (www.useme.nl/kaartspellen). In the variation offered there: \n\n\nThe whole pack is dealt every time - 13 cards each to four players. \nBidding is simultaneous. \nScore 1 point for each trick won, plus a bonus of 10 is you make your bid exactly. \nIf you bid and make zero you score 20 points. \nIf your score is 80 or more you do not take part in the bidding, but just score 1 for each trick you win. \nThe objective is to score exactly 100; if you go over 100 you bounce back - your excess over 100 is subtracted from 100. \n\n\nRelated games\n\nLa Podrida is the equivalent Spanish game to Oh Hell!, played with a 52-card pack. There is also a similar game La Pocha, played with the 40-card Spanish deck. \n\nRomanian Whist is a variation of Oh Hell!, played in Romania with a 32-card pack.\n\n\nDavid Parlett\'s 36-card game Ninety-Nine is based on similar principles, but with an extra twist to the bidding.\n\nGerman Bridge is a version of Oh Hell played in Hong Kong. You gain  (10 + (bid)2) if successful and lose (bid - tricks)2 if not.\nNominations or Clag is a British variant which adds some extra deals with special rules.\nOther Oh Hell WWW pages\nDavid Zechiel\'s page gives Al Okenuff\'s rules of Oh Hell, in which the highest bidder chooses trumps; the scores for high bids escalate in such a way that it is worth going set on a low bid if by doing so you can destroy the high bidder\'s bid as well.\nNicholas Cheung\'s Oh Hell page.\n\nRules of Oh Hell are available on the Card Game Heaven site.\nArchive copy of Dave Barker\'s former page of Rules for Oh Hell\nArchive copy of Brad Wilson\'s former Oh Shit! page.\nJean-Franois Bustarret\'s page L\'Ascenseur has rules in French.\n\nSoftware\nMalcolm Bain\'s shareware Oh Hell program for Windows includes a Blackout-style scoring option. \nSean O\'Connor\'s shareware Oh Hell program is available under the name Niggle - you can buy it or download a free trial version.\nYou can download a freeware Oh Hell! program from Thanos Card Games.\nFar Whist is a free program by Vincent Brvart with which you can play Elevator Whist, Oh Hell!,  Romanian Whist and many other variations.\nFrom Axel Brink\'s 10 op en neer page (in Dutch) you can obtain his computer program that plays a variation of Oh Hell in which the number of cards dealt per hand are: 1, 2, ..., 9, 10, 9, ..., 1.

If he misses his bid (over or under), he gets 0 points.\nJack Marrows has written a two-player Oh Shit! program with which you can play online against the computer.

It has been known by a number of similar names, such as Bock or Bocken in Germany and Bog or Poque in France. The current Icelandic version Pkk is described on another page of this site. Variations of Poch are played in North America under the names Tripoli and Three in One, and boards are sold there under various proprietary names: Tripoley, Rummoli, Michigan Rummy, etc. A detailed early history of the game can be found in an article by Thierry Depaulis: "Pochspiel: An \'International\' Card Game of the 15th Century", published in The Playing-Card (Journal of the International Playing-Card Society) in three parts, in Vol XIX No 2 (Nov 1990), Vol XIX No 3 (Feb 1991) and Vol XIX No 4 (May 1991).\nOn this page the modern German form of Poch is described first, based on rules supplied with a modern board, on various books, and on information from Jan Bttcher. There follow summaries of differences in the 18th and 19th century versions of the game.\nPlayers and Equipment\nFrom 3 to 6 players can take part and a 32-card pack is used, the cards ranking from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7. Each player has an equal supply of chips. A board (Pochbrett) in the centre of the table is used to hold chips staked to the the various pools until they are won. There are many designs of Poch board - here is a modern example:\n\nIf a ready-made board is not to hand it is fairly easy to make your own. You need places for the nine pools: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Marriage (marked King-Queen on the board), Sequence (marked 7-8-9 on the board), Pocher (marked with a Joker on the board) and the centre pot (unlabelled).\nStake and Deal\nThe first dealer is chosen at random and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. Before each deal, every player must put one chip into each of the nine pools.\nThe dealer deals out the cards clockwise, one at a time, and places the last card face up on the table. Unless there are three players. Some of the players will have one more card than others: this does not matter. The last card belongs to no one; the suit of this card is the "pay suit".\nThe Play\nFirst Stage\nThe players who hold the Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten of the pay suit collect the chips from the relevant pools. If one player holds the King and Queen of the pay suit, that player takes the marriage pool. If one player holds the Seven, Eight and Nine or the pay suit, that player takes the contents of the sequence pool.\nIn many deals no one wins the Marriage or Sequence pools. In this case the chips remain in the pool, and players will continue to add further chips before each deal even though they are not empty. If an Ace, King, Queen, Jack or Ten is turned up by the dealer as the pay suit card, then no one wins the pool corresponding to that card, and it is carried over to the next deal and added to in the same way.\nSecond Stage\nIn this stage, players bet on who has the best set of cards of the same rank. The betting process is known as Pochen. Any set of four of a kind beats any set of three of a kind, and any three of a kind beats any pair. A set of higher ranking cards beats a set of the same number of lower ranking cards. If two players have pairs of the same rank, the pair containing the card of the pay suit is better. Example: 8-8-8-8 beats K-K-K, which beats 9-9-9, which beats Q-Q, which beats Q-Q if diamonds or hearts is the pay suit.\nNote that the only combinations that are allowed here are pairs, triples and fours of a kind, and only the best combination of each player is compared. If you have two pairs you only count the higher one. If you have a triple and a pair your hand just counts as a triple (there is no such thing as a "full house" in this game). If all your cards are different ranks, you are not allowed to take part in the Pochen at all.\nStarting with the player to the left of the dealer and going round clockwise., players can pass if the cannot or do not wish to bet, or can bet 1 or more chips that they have the best hand. To bet you say "Ich poche 1" or "Ich poche 3" or whatever amount you want to bet, placing that number of chips towards the centre of the table. Subsequent players can either match your bet, raise the bet by staking a larger number of chips, or drop out (fold). The betting continues around the table for as many circuits as necessary until the amounts bet by the players who have stayed in are equal. (When you drop out of the betting you sacrifice any chips you may already have bet on an earlier round.)\nWhen the bets are equal, each of the players who has stayed in shows the combination (pair, triple or quartet) on which they were betting, and the owner of the best combination takes all the chips that were bet and the contents of the Pochen pool.\nIf everyone passes, the contents of the Pochen pool stay there and are added to before the next deal.\nIf only one player bets, or if all players but one drop out during the betting, then the only bettor naturally takes the Pochen pool and all the stakes, having shown a pair or better to prove entitlement to win them.\nI have not seen explicit rules about betting limits or what happens when players do not have enough chips to equal another player\'s bet. Since Poch is nowadays usually played as a family game with no money at stake, this probably does not matter much. If it were played for money, it would be sensible to have a system similar to Poker, where if you do not have enough chips to equal the last bet you can stake all your remaining chips. At the end of the betting you will have a showdown against everyone who has bet at least as much as you, but if you win you only get from each of them an amount equal to your stake; you would also get the contents of the Pochen pool. The players who bet more will have a showdown against each other and the best of their hands will win the remaining parts of their stakes.\nThird Stage\nThe winner of the Pochen (or the player to dealer\'s left if everyone passed) begins the play and can play any card from their hand face up in the centre (on top of the centre pot on the board). Whoever holds the next higher card of the same suit plays it, and this continues until a point is reached where no one has the next card (because it has already been played or because it was the face up pay suit card).\nThe person who played the last and highest card of the sequence begins again, playing any card, and again the cards are played in ascending sequence in suit. This continues until a player runs out of cards.\nThe player who first plays their last card is the winner of the third stage. This player collects the contents of the centre pot, and in addition is paid by each of the other players one chip for each card they still have in their hands.\nEnding the Game\nThe game usually continues until someone runs out of chips. Often this will happen when someone does not have the necessary 9 chips to place on the board when the cards are dealt. The remaining players then count their chips and the winner is the player with most chips. Any unclaimed chips on the board remain there and are not won by anybody. Often there will be unclaimed ships in the Sequence and Marriage pools.\nVariations\nSome play that if the dealer turns up an Ace, King, Queen, Jack or Ten as the centre card, the dealer takes the corresponding pool. In that case, these pools are always won by somebody.\nSome play that the card turned up to determine the pay suit belongs to the player whose turn it is to receive a card in the normal dealing order.\nSome play that it is possible to take part in the Pochen without even a pair of matching cards. If none of the players in the showdown has even a pair, the highest single card wins. In this case it is usual to use Skat order of suits - clubs (high), spades, hearts, diamonds (low) - to break single ties, and between tied pairs the pair containing the club is higher, irrespective of the pay suit.\nIt would be possible to play for money, giving a value to each chip. In this case, at the end of the game any unclaimed chips on the board should be distributed as equally as possible to the players, and everyone then receives or pays money according to the number of chips they have more or less than their initial supply.\nLe Poque in the late 18th century\nThe following summary is based on the rules of Le Poque in the Acadmie Universelle des Jeux, Amsterdam, 1789.\n\nThe differences from the modern German game are as follows.\n\n\nLe Poque is played with a 36-card pack, including sixes, when there are more than four players; three or four players use the 32-card pack as above.\nThe Poque board has only six pools: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Poque.\nAt one point it is stated that the fifth pool is labelled with a Ten and a Nine, which suggests that both cards of the pay suit might be required to win it, but this is contradicted elsewhere in the text.\nLe Poque is dealt and played counter-clockwise; the first bet in the second stage was made by the player to dealer\'s right.\nOnly five cards are dealt to each player: two at a time and then three at a time. The dealer then turns the next card face up to determine the pay suit. The remaining cards are left in a face down stack and not used, with the result that the play in the third stage is often interrupted when the next card required is in the undealt portion of the pack.\nThe dealer takes the relevant pool if the card turned to indicate the pay suit is an Ace, King, Queen, Jack or Ten.\nThe betting stage takes place before the players who hold pay suit cards corresponding to the pools collect their winnings. The poque pot is won by the player who has the best hand in the showdown as usual. If all but one player drops out, the surviving player can win the pot even without a pair.\nThere is no pool for the third stage, in which the cards are played out in suit and sequence as in the modern game. The player who runs out of cards first collects from all the others a number of chips equal to the cards in their hands as usual. In addition, the player who has most cards has to pay this number of chips to each opponent. It is unclear what happens if two players tie for most cards - perhaps they share the payment.\n\nPoch in the 19th century\nThe following description, contributed by David Parlett, is based on Hoffmann: Der Meister in Allen Kartenspielen (Hamburg 1873, first edition 1810).\nPhase 1. From three to six players each put an agreed stake into each of the first seven of eight compartments labelled Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Marriage, Sequence, and Poch. Five cards each are dealt from a 32- or 52-card pack and the next is turned for trump. Anyone dealt the trump Ace wins the stake on Ace, and so for the other compartments. The marriage stake is won by anyone dealt both King and Queen of trumps, in addition to those of the separate King and Queen pool, and that of sequence similarly for holding the 7-8-9 of trumps. Any stake not so won is carried forward to the next deal.\nPhase 2. The stake for poch is then contested by vying as to who holds the best combination, for which purpose a quartet beats a triplet, a triplet a pair, and a pair an unpaired hand, the highest card settling ties. Each in turn may bet or fold. The first to bet does so by placing any stake in the compartment labelled poch and announcing Ich poche eins (I bet one, or however many). Each of those who have not folded may at their turn either fold, stay, or raise. At a showdown the best hand wins the poch, but precise details of the vying procedure are ambiguous.\nPhase 3. Finally, cards are played out in sequences in suit after the manner of Stops games (Newmarket, Michigan, etc.). A player ending a sequence is paid by the others and starts a new one, and the first out of cards wins one for each card left unplayed in all the others hands.\nNote: Stops games did not appear before the 16th century, and in the earliest form of Pochen the final stake was won by whoever most nearly reached a count of 31.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Matching games > Stops group > Poch\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2005.

It is played on a standard size blackjack table that can accommodate up to six players.\nEquipment\nThe game uses a set of Chinese dominoes, three dice and chips for betting,\nas in regular Pai Gow.  The table layout has extra circles for three kinds\nof bets.\nThe Deal\n\nSee Pai Gow\nThe Play\n\nThe play is the same as regular Pai Gow.  The players must form two hands, called the high hand and the low hand, by using their four\ntiles. The high hand must be higher than or at least equal to the low hand\naccording to the standard Pai Gow ranking.  After all players have made their decisions, the Banker turns over his four tiles and forms a high hand\nand a low hand appropriately.\n\nBetting & Payout\nThe difference is in the betting.  Each player has three options in front\nof his position at the table.  There is the traditional bet to win, the\nBonus bet and the Tie bet.  There are three betting circles in front of\neach player.  The circle with a seat number inside is where the regular Pai\nGow bet is placed.  The circle labeled "B" is where the Bonus bet is\nplaced.  The circle labeled "T" is where the Tie bet is placed.  The\nregular bet is not mandatory, therefore, Tie and Bonus are more than a side\nbet.\nRegular Bet\nThe regular bet is simply the standard Pai Gow bet.\nEach player competes against the Banker.  The player wins if his high hand\nis higher than that of the Banker and his low hand is also higher than that\nof the Banker.  The player loses if neither of his hands beats the\nBanker\'s.  If the player wins one hand and loses the other, his bet pushes.\n If the Player and Banker hands both have the same total, the\nhighest-ranking tile in the hand breaks the tie.  The Banker wins all ties\nif the highest-ranking tiles also tie.  When both low hands equal 0, the\nBanker wins the low hand.\nTie Bet\nA player can bet that his hand and the dealer hand will tie.  In the event\nof a tie, whereas a player with a wager on the regular bet pushes, a Tie\nbettor will win even money, or be paid at 25:1 or 20:1 if his low hand is\nat least a Gong.  If the player also plays the regular bet, then both bets\nare adjudicated by the same hand set by the player.  In other words, the\nplayer is only allowed to set his hand once, but not separately.  No\ncommission is charged on a winning Tie bet.\nBonus Bet\nUnlike the regular bet, the Bonus bet player doesn\'t compete against the\ndealer.  With a Bonus bet, the player will win if his four tiles make up\none of the eight Bonus hands illustrated below.\nBonus Pay Tables\nWinning Hands\nSupreme Pair and Heaven Pair=200 to 1\nSupreme Pair and Earth Pair=60 to 1\nHeaven Pair and Earth Pair=30 to 1\nLame Duck=20 to 1\nTwo Pairs=12 to 1\nSupreme, Heaven or Earth Pair=5 to 1\nOne Pair=2 to 1\nWong=1 to 1\nNo commission is charged on a winning Bonus bet.\nThe player is eligible to win the bonus if any two of his four tiles can\nform a pair or Wong.  Should his hand comprise both a pair and Wong, only\nthe pair will be paid the bonus.\nFurthermore, if the player also plays the regular bet, the bonus will be\npaid no matter how the player sets his high and low hands.\nThe Bonus bet has a unique feature in that not only will the player win big\nawards for favorable results in rare instances, but also receive an award\nfor the worst hand.  A "Lame Duck," the worst Pai Gow hand that comprises a\nhigh 6, a low 6, any 7 and any 4, pays 20 to 1.  Making the Bonus bet not\nonly turns a disappointment into a pleasant surprise for the player but\nalso insures against a sure loss for the regular bet.\nComments & Strategy\nUnlike standard Pai Gow wherein pushes occur about 40% of the time, the Tie\nbet and the Bonus bet in Bonanza Pai Gow result in a decision every hand.\nAlso, in standard Pai Gow the house edge is vastly reduced if the players\nbank every other hand, whereas the house edge on the Bonus bet and the Tie\nbet never changes whether the players bank or not.\nThe Tie bet should appeal to regular Pai Gow players because their\nexperience tells them ties occur very often.  Player appeal is also\nenhanced by the high hit frequency and high payoff odds.  The Bonus bet\nplayers will win once every 3.7 hands.\nBonanza Pai Gow was introduced at Crown Casino, Melbourne, Australia in\nJanuary 2001 and by June 2001 all 6 of their standard Pai Gow games had\nbeen converted to Bonanza Pai Gow.  Bonanza Pai Gow increased their hold\npercentage vastly, achieving an increase of between $50 and $70 per table\nper open hour in comparison to standard Pai Gow games.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Tile Games > Chinese Domino Games > Bonanza Pai Gow\n    \n\n\nThis page was contributed by Joe Celko (jcelko212@earthlink.net).\n      \n       Joe Celko 2002.

Three Card Monte is the American name for it. In Britain it is usually called Find the Lady, and the equivalent French game is Bonneteau.\nThe appearance of the game is simple. It is played between the dealer (or tosser), who manipulates the cards and takes the bets, and the punter, a more or less gullible member of the public who places a bet on the game in the (unrealistic) hope of winning some money.\nThe dealer has three cards, one of which is a queen. These cards are shown to the punter and then simultaneously thrown face-down on a table. The punter is invited to bet on which card is the queen. The dealer will employ various tricks, often with the help of accomplices, to ensure that the punter loses.\nNormally the operators of the game work as a team:\n\nThe Tosser (dealer) is the sleight of hand man who mixes the cards and takes the bets\nThe Shills are accomplices who pose as punters making bets, to give real punters the impression that the game can be beaten\nThe Lookout watches for cops (police) and signals their approach so that the game can be "folded up" quickly \nThe Muscle Man takes care of anyone who decides to complain \nThe Roper seeks out likely punters and encourages them to join the game\n\nIf you do happen to bet on the right card, the Tosser may employ various tactics, such as accepting instead a wrong bet from a Shill and refusing your bet on the grounds that only one bet can be taken at a time, or swapping the cards while your attention is distracted, or simply arranging for the table to be knocked over and declaring the deal void.\nBonneteau\nThis description of the French version of the game was contributed by Jean-Pierre Coulon.\n\nBonneteau is described here as a warning to card enthusiasts visiting France, who might lose about 1000 French francs (150 Euro) within minutes if they happen to join such a game.\nThis game is often played in the street on a "table" made with a stack of two packing cases. Only three cards are needed, two from a black suit, and one from a red suit (or the opposite). The cards are slightly bent around their long axis, in a way similar to Mediterranean tiles, to facilitate their picking up from the "table". Hence the name Bonneteau, a little cap.\nThe "dealer" shows all three cards to you, lays them face-down on the "table", and rapidly picks up one card with his left hand and the other two in his right hand, and drops them back on the table at new positions.  He repeats this scheme a couple of times. Now you have to bet the position of the card which is alone in its suit. In other words this is a contest between your eyes and the "dealer\'s" hands. A typical bet is 200 French francs.\nYou will easily win the first few deals, but afterwards you won\'t win a single one, because the "dealer" uses the following trick. There are two cards in his right hand. The upper card is held between his thumb and his forefinger, and the lower card is held between his thumb and his middle finger, with a small gap (a few millimeters) between both cards. According to common sense, the "dealer" should drop the lower card first, but his forefinger surreptitiously ejects the upper card first, which causes you to lose track of the right card. This is especially difficult to see if the "dealer\'s" hand makes a sweeping move from his left side to his right side while he drops the cards.\nOne variation is as follows. An accomplice diverts the dealer\'s attention, taps your shoulder, and bends a corner of the right card, to help you following it. But the dealer has a trick to simultaneously unbend this card, and bend the other card he is holding in the same hand.\nStrategy\nDon\'t play it! Do not think you will win because you know the trick - you would be in great danger. Do not be misled by noticing some players who quit the game after some winnings. They are accomplices of the dealer - a part of the swindle.\nYou may play the game with your friends provided:\n\nno real money is involved. \nyou explain the trick afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Miscellaneous Games > Three Card Monte\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1999, 2001.

Although it is a trick-taking game unrelated to Poker, it has become known to Poker players in North America as an alternative choice in home Poker games. The game is of French origin. It is a descendant of Bourre, a three-card game which was popular in southwest France in the early 20th century, which was probably descended in turn from the Spanish game Burro ("donkey"). In the French game a player who plays and takes no tricks is said to be "bourr", and it is this term that gives its name to the Louisiana game Bourr, which is sometimes spelled with just one \'r\': (bour). Sometimes this is altered to "bourre" or "boure" by American writers unfamiliar with French accents, and often it is written "booray" or "boo-ray" which in American spelling approximates the French pronunciation of bourr.\nThe information on this page relies heavily on the book Bour by Roy J Nickens (Baton Rouge, 1972) as well as correspondence from John May, Brad Duhon, Victoria Diemer and others.\nPlayers and Cards\nThe game is best for seven players. In theory any number from two to eight can play, but with fewer than about five players the game becomes less interesting.\nA standard international 52-card pack without jokers is used. The cards of each suit rank from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2.\nAnte and Deal\nBefore the first deal each player must contribute an ante of one chip to the pot. Before subsequent deals, certain players may not have to pay an ante, depending on the result of the previous hand - see below.\nAny player who wishes to may shuffle and the dealer has the right to shuffle last. The cards must then be cut by the player to dealer\'s right.\nThe dealer deals out the cards one at a time, starting with the player to dealer\'s left and continuing clockwise until each player has five cards. Cards are dealt face down, except for the dealer\'s fifth and last card, which is dealt face up. The suit of this card indicates the trump suit.\nThe turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nDraw or Pass\nPlayers pick up their cards and look at them, but may not show their cards to anyone else.\nBeginning with the player to dealer\'s left, each player in clockwise order must declare whether he or she will pass or play, and if playing, how many cards he or she wishes to discard.\nIf you pass, you stack your cards face down in front of you.and take no further part in the play of the hand. You can no longer win the pot on that deal, nor can you lose any additional chips.\nIf you play, you may discard some of your cards face down, announcing how many you are discarding. The dealer then deals you an equal number of replacement cards from the undealt part of the deck. You may discard your whole hand of five cards if you wish to, or if you are happy with your original cards you may stand pat and play with the hand you were dealt, discarding nothing.\nIt may happen, especially in an eight-player game, that the dealer runs out of cards to deal before all the players who wish to play have been served with replacements for their discards. In that case the dealer gathers up all the discarded cards and passed hands from the players who have already acted (but not the discards of the player who is currently being served). These cards are shuffled and cut and used to continue dealing cards to replace any remaining discards.\nIf the turned up trump card is an ace, the dealer must play. There is no risk in doing so since the ace of trumps always wins a trick.\nIf only one player elects to play, all the others passing, the lone player is deemed to have won all five tricks by default, and this player therefore collects the whole pot without playing out any cards. If all players other than the dealer pass, the dealer should of course play and collect the pot.\nYou should be careful not to make any premature announcement or gesture indicating whether you intend to play or pass or how many cards you might discard, before it is your turn to act. The penalty is to forfeit your next turn to deal.\nThe Play\nThe player to dealer\'s left, or if this player has passed, the next player in clockwise rotation who is playing, leads to the first trick. Thereafter the winner of each trick leads to the next.\nA card is led by placing it face up in the centre of the table. Each of the other active players (those who have not passed) in clockwise order must also play a card face up in the centre. When all have played a card, the trick is complete. It is won by whoever played the highest card of the trump suit, or if no trump was played, by whoever played the highest card of the suit that was led.\nThe play of the cards is governed by strict rules.\n\nPlayers must always "follow suit" if able to - that is, all but the first to play to a trick must play a card of the same suit as the card that was led.\nAny player who is unable to follow suit, having no card of the suit that was led, must play a trump if able to.\nSubject to the requirement to follow suit, each player must play a card that beats the highest card so far played to the trick if possible.\n\nA player who is unable to beat the highest card played to the trick, is still forced to follow suit if possible, and otherwise to trump. If the trick has already been trumped, and you are unable to follow suit, you must overtrump if possible, but if your trumps are not high enough to overtrump, you must still play a trump.\nHowever, if you are unable to beat the highest card in the trick, you are under no obligation to play a high card, provided that you obey the rules of following suit or trumping. Example: spades are trumps and the queen of diamonds is led. The second player trumps with the four of spades. Playing third, you hold the ace and six of diamonds and some spades. You have diamonds so you are not allowed to trump, and therefore cannot win the trick. You can and should play your six of diamonds, not the ace. If the second player had played a diamond, you would have been obliged to play the ace of diamonds, to beat the queen.\nA player who has no card of the suit led and has no trumps either can play any card, but of course cannot win the trick.\nIf the dealer is playing, the dealer\'s card that was dealt face up to determine the trump suit counts as belonging to the dealer\'s hand (except in the very unusual case that the dealer chose to discard it) and is played in accordance with the rules of play above.\nA player who has three sure tricks irrespective of how the cards are played, and is therefore certain to win the pot, is said to have a cinch. In this case there are additional restrictions.\n\nIf you have a cinch and it is your turn to lead, you must lead your highest trump. \nIf you have a cinch and are playing on a trick to which another player led, and you are able to play a trump to the trick, you must play your highest trump.\nIf you have a cinch and are playing last to a trick, there are no special restrictions - you must simply win the trick if you can, subject to the usual restrictions of following suit and trumping.\n\nNote that your hand can be a cinch at the start of the play if you have a trump holding such as A-K-Q or K-Q-10-9-8. It can become a cinch later, for example if after winning a trick you have two sure trump tricks. Also, if you win the first three tricks, the cinch rules apply since you are sure to take the pot, and you must lead a trump to the fourth trick if you have one.\nWhen you are required to play your "highest" trump because your hand is a cinch, the play of an adjacent trump - such as the King from Ace-King or the Jack from King-Jack when the Queen has already been played - is acceptable.\nPayments\nThe player who wins most tricks takes the whole pot. To win the pot it is necessary to win more tricks than any other single player. Three tricks are always sufficient. The pot can be won with two tricks if three other players take one trick each.\nIf there is a tie for most tricks (when the tricks divide 2-2-1, and in the rare case of five players taking one trick each) no one takes the pot. This is known as a "split pot" but the pot is not shared out - it remains for the next deal and the new antes and any penalties are added to it.\nAnyone who plays and takes no trick is said to have gone "bourr". These players must pay an amount equal to the whole contents of the pot. This payment forms part of the pot for the next deal.\nA player who goes bourr does not have to place the normal one chip ante for the next deal. Also, if the pot is split, the players who tied for most tricks do not post an ante for the next deal. All remaining players pay one chip ante as usual.\nIn the following example the seven players are A, B, C, D, E, F and G.\nDeal 1: All seven players ante so there are 7 chips in the pot. B, C, E and G play; the others pass. E wins 3 tricks, B and G win one each and C is bourr. E takes the 7 chips from the pot. C must pay 7 chips to the next pot. All players must ante for the next deal except for C. Therefore the pot now contains 13 chips.\nDeal 2: With 13 chips in the pot, A, B, E and F play. The others pass. A and F take 2 tricks each, B takes one and E none. This is a spilt pot between A and F, so no one wins it. E has to add 13 chips to the pot, and B, C, D and G each ante one chip for the next deal, so the pot now contains 30 chips.\nDeal 3: Only C, D and E play, and D wins all five tricks. D takes the 30 chips from the pot and C and E must each pay 30 chips to the next pot. In addition everyone except C and E must pay an ante for the next deal, and the pot now contains 65 chips.\nIt should be clear from this example that the pot can sometimes build rather quickly, especially if more than one player is bourr or there is a split pot. For this reason the game is sometimes played with a limit. For example if the limit is 20 chips, then when the pot contains more than 20 chips, a player who wins takes only 20 chips from the pot, and a player who is bourr pays only 20 chips.\nAny play that is not in accordance with the rules of play - such as failure to follow suit, failure to trump or failure to beat the highest card in the trick when able, is known as a renege. If the renege is not corrected before the next player plays a card, the penalty is to pay an amount equal to the size of the pot, exactly as though the player had gone bourr.\nHowever, if having reneged you realise your error before the next player plays, you are allowed to recall your card and substitute a correct card. In this case you forfeit the right to win the pot, even if you take most tricks, and you forfeit your next turn to deal, but you do not have to match the pot (unless you win no tricks).\nVariations\nDouble Ante\nIn this variation, all players pay an ante of one chip before the deal, and in addition, any player who decides to play must pay an additional chip to the pot. Those who pass do not pay this second ante - they just lose their first ante and forgo their chance to win the pot in this deal.\nIn the double ante game, it is normal to require an initial ante from all players, including those who paid for a bourr or were involved in a split pot on the previous deal.\nSome play that the decisions whether or not to play and how many cards to draw are separated into two separate rounds. First each player in turn declares either "play" (paying a second ante of one chip) or "pass". After everyone has declared, there is a second round in which those who decided to play discard cards if they wish and are dealt replacements.\nSeparate Trump Card\nSome play that five cards are dealt face down to each player, and then an extra card is dealt face up to determine the trump suit. There are two forms of this variation.\n\nThe turned up trump belongs to no one. It indicates the trump suit but cannot be taken or played by any player.\nThe turned up trump can be taken by the dealer if he or she decides to play. The dealer effectively has six cards; if for example the dealer discards four cards and elects to use the turned up trump, three replacement cards will be dealt to make up the dealer\'s five-card hand.\n\nSimultaneous Declaration\nSome play that instead of declaring in rotation, all players decide independently whether they will play or pass. Those who want to play hold a chip in their closed fist; those who pass hold an empty fist. All reveal their decisions simultaneously and then those who decided to play discard in rotation as ussual.\nI suspect that this variation is not traditional in Louisiana, but was adopted by poker players, who use a similar method for declaring high or low in some hi-lo games.\nFour card Bourr\nVictoria Diemer reports that in Indiana, Bourr is played with just four cards dealt to each player, with a separate card that belongs to no one indicating the trump suit. Players must have at least one trump or at least one club (a "dirty club") to play, which costs one chip. After players have decided whether to stay, up to 3 cards can be discarded, but not all four. After the draw, players have another chance to pass; those who want to play must pay an additional chip. As usual the player who takes most chips wins the pot, and if there is a tie the pot is carried over to the next deal. Anyone who takes no tricks must match the pot for the next deal. The penalty for a renege is twice the pot.\nOther Bourr Web Sites\nAnother description of Bourr is available on Wikipedia.\nRules of a simplified version of Boo-Ray can be found in Peter Sarrett\'s Game Report site (archive copy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Trump group > Rams Group > Bourr\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2006, 2009.

It is a fairly simple stops game in which the aim is to get rid of your cards first, and to win stakes by playing particular cards.\n\nThere is a variation called Three in One in which before the stops part, each player selects 5 cards from their hand and plays a game of Poker with them. That version is also known as Michigan Rummy, though according the books "Michigan Rum" is actually rummy game - a version of 500 Rum. \n\nCards and Layout\n\nA standard 52 card deck is used. The cards in each suit rank from lowest to highest: 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A.\n\nDuring the game stakes are placed on a layout. This can be a board or cloth, or can be made by laying out cards from a second deck on which the stakes are placed. The layout consists of areas representing the following cards: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  These are sometimes called the pay cards or boodle cards.\n  \nPlacing Stakes and Dealing\n\nBefore the deal, the dealer places two chips on each boodle card and the other players put one chip on each. \n\nThe deal is clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The dealer deals one hand to each player and one spare hand. All of the cards are dealt out one at a time; some players will have one card more than others, but this does not matter. The players look at their cards, and the spare hand is left face down and not used in the game.\n\nThe Play\n\nAll plays are made by placing a card face up on the table in front of you. The different players\' cards are not mixed together but are kept in front of the person who played them until the end of the play.\n\nThe person to the left of the dealer begins. They can play any suit, but must play the lowest card they hold in that suit. Whoever has the next higher card of the same suit must now play it, followed by the holder of the card after that, and so on until either the ace is reached or no one can play because no one holds the next higher card of the suit (it might be in the spare hand or have been played earlier). A card which no one can follow, because no one has the next higher card in that suit, is called a stop card.\n\nThe last person who played a card (the ace or the stop card) now starts again. Again they can play any suit but must play the lowest card they hold in that suit. \n\nDuring the play, anyone who manages to play a card which matches one of the boodle cards takes all the chips on that card.\n\nAs soon as any player runs out of cards, the play ends. All the other players must pay one chip for each card remaining in their hand. The player who ran out of cards collects all of these chips.\n\nAny chips remaining on the layout stay there for the next hand.\n\nVariations\n\nFree placement of chips\nSome play that at the start of the hand you must put a fixed number of chips on the layout (say 6), but you can distribute them as you like among the boodle cards. For example you could put all 6 chips on one card if you wanted to. As this happens before the deal, there is of course no way of knowing which cards are the best investment.\nDealer exchanges or auctions the spare hand\nSome play that if you are the dealer, after you have dealt and looked at your cards, you have the option of exchanging your hand for the face down spare hand. You are not allowed to look at the spare hand before deciding to exchange. Alternatively, if you do not want to exchange, you can auction the unseen spare hand to the highest bidder. The person (if any) who buys the spare hand discards their own original hand face down and pays the dealer in chips the amount bid for the spare hand.\nCompulsory change of suit\nSome play that when starting again after a stop or and ace, you must if possible play a card of a different suit from the one that was just played. If you can\'t play a different suit, there are two views as to what happens:\n\nIf you have no option, you can play the same suit.\nIf you have nothing but cards of the suit that was just played, the turn to play passes to the next player to your left. If no one has any other suit the play ends at this point, and there is no payment for the cards players have left in their hands.\n\n\nMichigan Rummy / Three in One\n\nIn this game, after the deal but before the actual Michigan, each player selects five of their cards and plays a round of Poker with them. The stake layout is also somewhat different from the normal Michigan / Boodle layout. See the Three in One page for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Matching games > Stops group > Michigan / Newmarket\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2000.

My thanks to Gejus van Diggele for introducing me to these players.\n\nIntroduction\nPlayers and Cards\nRoem and Stuk\nBidding\nExchanging the Centre Cards\nPlay\nScoring\nVariations\nOther Boonaken Web Sites\n\nIntroduction\nThe Dutch game Boonaken, sometimes spelled Bonaken, Boonaaken, Boonhaaken, etc., belongs to the Jass family. It is related to Pandoeren, but is a faster, less complex and less serious game, usually played for rounds of drinks. It probably gets its name from the beginnings of the words for the top three trumps, which are the Jack, Nine and Ace - in Dutch: Boer, Nel, Aas. The game played at Hazerswoude-Rijndijk is described first, followed by some variations played in other places.\nPlayers and Cards\nThe game is probably best for four or five players; and it is possible to play with as many as six or seven (see variations). The game is played to find a loser, who will pay for a round of drinks. During the game, the number of active players reduces as the winners drop out.\nA 32 card pack is used, consisting of ace, king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7 in each of the four suits hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. This is a point trick game with trumps. The ranking of the cards from high to low and their point values are shown in the following table.\n\nTrump suitNon-trump suits\n\nCardValue\nJack (Boer)20 points\n9 (Nel)14 points\nAce (Aas)11 points\nKing (Heer)3 points\nQueen (Vrouw)2 points\n1010 points\n80 points\n70 points\n\nCardValue\nAce (Aas)11 points\nKing (Heer)3 points\nQueen (Vrouw)2 points\nJack (Boer)1 point\n1010 points\n90 points\n80 points\n70 points\n\n\nThere are 141 points in the pack altogether. In contrast to other Jass games, in this game there are no extra points for winning the last trick.\nRoem and Stuk\nCertain combinations of cards in a player\'s hand are known as Roem, and have a point value. A sequence consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit, and for this purpose the cards are always considered to be in the order A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7, so Q-J-10-9 of trumps is a four card sequence, but J-9-A-K is not a sequence, even though these are the top four trumps. The combinations and their values are:\nSequence of three cards in a suit20 points\nSequence of four cards in a suit50 points\nSequence of five cards in a suit100 points\nSequence of six cards in a suit200 points\nFour jacks200 points\nFour queens100 points\nFour kings100 points\nFour aces100 points\nKing and queen of trumps (known as Stuk)20 points\nA single card cannot be used in more than one sequence, but the same card can be used simultaneously in a sequence, a four of a kind and Stuk. For example K-Q-J-10 of trumps is worth 70 points - 50 for the sequence and 20 for the stuk. Four aces with the king and queen of trumps are worth a total of 140.\nDeal\nThe dealer shuffles and the player to the dealer\'s right cuts. Deal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The dealer deals six cards to each player, three at a time. \n\nIf there are five players, two cards are placed face up in the centre of the table, one after each round of three cards to each player has been dealt.\nIf there are four players, then after the first three cards to each player two cards are placed face down in the centre and after the second round of three cards each, two cards are placed face up in the centre. The four cards that are left over at the end of the deal are set aside until the end of the hand.\nIf there are two or three players, the deal is the same as with four players, but the number of cards set aside is of course greater: 10 cards with three players and 16 cards with two players.\n\nThe exact point in the deal at which the two or four centre cards are dealt is not critical, and different dealers use different methods, but the cards given to the players are always dealt three at a time. \n\nThe eventual winner of the bidding can use the centre cards to improve his or her hand, so when deciding what to bid, you can reckon on having the face-up centre cards in your hand, and you may also speculate on getting some further help from the face-down centre cards, which may sometimes be useful.\nBidding\nThe player to the left of the dealer bids first. There are four types of bid:\n\nA number bid, which must be a multiple of 5, is an undertaking to win at least that many points in tricks plus roem, with a trump suit of your choice.\nMisre is an undertaking to lose every trick, with no trumps. It ranks between the number bids 70 and 75.\nZwabber is an undertaking to win every trick, with no trumps. It ranks between the number bids 100 and 105.\nBoonaak is an undertaking to win every trick, with a trump suit of your choice. It is the highest type of bid.\n\n\n\nPlayers bid in clockwise rotation, each player passing or bidding higher than the previous bidder (with the exception of Misre). A player who has passed cannot re-enter the bidding. When all players but one have passed, the last remaining player is the declarer and the final bid is played.\nIf all players were to pass initially, there would be a redeal, but in practice this never happens, because if all players but one were to pass, the final player could easily bid and make a cheap number contract.\nIf the highest bid so far is Misre, it is possible for other players also to bid Misre. Once there have been two Misre bids, no higher bids are allowed, but all the players who have not yet passed decide in turn whether they will pass or also bid a Misre. All the players who bid Misre then simultaneously try to take no tricks.\nWhen there has been only one Misre bid, it can be overcalled in the usual way by a number bid of 75 or more or a Zwabber or Boonaak. The higher bid cancels the Misre and no further Misres can be bid. Players who want to bid a number sometimes begin the bidding at 75 so as to prevent later players from shutting them out by bidding Misre.\nA Boonaak bid can include a quantity of Roem. For example "Boonaak 50" is an undertaking that one will take all the tricks and will have at least 50 Roem. Boonaak with Roem outbids Boonaak without Roem, and can in turn be outbid by Boonaak with more Roem. The highest bid of all is Boonaak 220; to make this you would need A-K-Q-J-10-9 in one suit (200 for the sequence plus 20 for stuk).\nExchanging the centre cards\nThe declarer takes the two or four cards from the centre of the table and discards an equal number of cards face down in their place, possibly including some or all of the same cards. Points in discarded cards to not count towards fulfilling the declarer\'s bid, and discarded cards cannot be used in announced Roem.\nIf the contract is Misre, the first player who bid Misre takes the centre cards and discards the same number of cards face down. If more than one player bid Misre, the second Misre bidder picks up the cards discarded by the first and discards an equal number of cards, to be picked up by the third Misre bidder, and so on, until all Misre bidders have had an opportunity to exchange some cards.\nPlay\nThe declarer always leads to the first trick. If several Misres were bid, the first Misre bidder leads.\nIf the bid is a number or a Boonaak, the declarer chooses the trump suit. If the declarer leads to the first trick without saying anything, the suit of this first lead becomes trumps. It is usual to begin by leading a trump, but it is also possible for the declarer to announce the trump suit aloud and lead a different suit.\nWhen a trump is led, the other players must follow suit with a trump, unless their only trump is the jack. A player who has no trumps or only the jack of trumps may play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump played.\nWhen a non-trump is led, players who have a card of the suit led must either follow suit or play a trump. (It is legal to trump even if you could have followed suit.) Players who have no card of the suit led may play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if no trumps were played, by the highest card of the suit led.\nThe winner of each trick leads any card to the next trick.\nIf the bid is Misre or Zwabber, there is no trump suit. Players must follow suit; each trick is won by the highest card of the suit led; and as usual the winner of each trick leads to the next.\nIf the bid is a number, the declarer may announce Roem when leading to the first trick. Only the total value of the Roem is announced - for example 70 if you have K-Q-J-10 of trumps. Only cards in the declarer\'s hand count towards the declarer\'s Roem - discarded cards cannot be included.\nIt is illegal to announce an amount of Roem equal to or greater than your final number bid. For example, if you have bid 95 and find that after discarding you have Q-J-10-9-8 of trumps, you can only announce 50 Roem for a four-card sequence. If you had four aces, you would not be allowed to announce them if your bid was 100 or less.\nIf the bid is a number, and an opponent has Roem in hand worth at least as much as the Roem announced by the declarer, that opponent can also announce Roem. If the opponent\'s Roem is worth more than the declarer\'s, the declarer\'s Roem is cancelled and does not count towards fulfilling the bid. If an opponent\'s Roem is equal in value to the declarer\'s, both players must say how high their Roem is - i.e. what the highest card of it is. If the highest card of the opponent\'s Roem is equal or higher, the declarer\'s Roem is canceled. If the highest card of the declarer\'s Roem is higher, the declarer\'s Roem remains valid.\nIf the bid is a Boonaak with Roem, the declarer must have at least the amount of Roem claimed in the bid, otherwise the bid is lost. The declarer\'s Roem cannot be cancelled, even if an opponent has more Roem.\nRoem may only be announced when playing one\'s card to the first trick. Any Roem not announced at this time does not count.\nOpponents of the declarer are not allowed to announce Roem if the declarer has not announced Roem, or if their Roem is worth less than that announced by the declarer.\nScoring\nIf the bid was a number, then add up\n\nthe total value of the cards in the declarer\'s tricks, plus\nthe value of Roem announced by the declarer, provided that it was not cancelled.\n\nIf this is greater than or equal to the bid, the declarer has won. If not, the declarer has lost.\n\nIf the bid was Misre, then \n\nanyone who bid Misre and managed to avoid taking any tricks wins, and \nanyone who bid Misre and took one or more tricks loses.\n\n\n\nIf the bid was Zwabber or Boonaak and the declarer won every trick, the declarer wins. Otherwise the declarer loses.\nThe score sheet has a column for each player. A win is recorded by a plus sign (+) in that player\'s column. A loss is recorded by a minus sign (-). Only the declarer gets a "+" or "-"; nothing is written in the other players\' columns. When several people bid Misre, each of them gets a "+" or "-", depending whether they won or lost.\nThe game is played to find a loser, who will buy a round of drinks. This is decided as follows.\n\nAny player who has two pluses is a winner, and drops out of the game until the loser has been found. This player is said to be "out" (eruit). (If it was this player\'s turn to deal next, the deal passes another place to the left.)\nAny player who has two minuses is the loser of the game, and must buy the drinks. This player is said to be "in" (erin). The two minus signs can be converted to a representation of a drinking glass: .\nAs long as no one has two minuses, the players who have not won by getting two pluses continue playing hands. If all the players except one have two pluses, the last remaining player is the loser and buys the drinks.\n\n\n\nNote that pluses and minuses do not cancel each other. A player who has a plus and a minus is said to be in wip (a seesaw). The next time this player is declarer, he or she will either drop out by scoring a second plus or become the overall loser by scoring a second minus.\nIf a new game is to be played by the same group, the player to the right of loser of the previous game will deal the first hand, so that the previous loser will bid first.\nVariations\nPlayers and deal\nSome play that each hand after the first is dealt by the player who was the declarer in the previous hand (by the first declarer if several played Misre).\nWhen there are two, three or four players, some play that only one card is dealt face down to the centre, with two face up.\nIt is possible to start a game with 6 players, dealing only 5 cards each, and two face up to the centre, or even with 7 players, dealing just 4 cards each, with two cards face up and two face down in the centre. With seven players, some play that everyone is obliged to bid Misre on the first hand.\nBidding\nSome play that the minimum number bid allowed is 25.\nSome play that the Misre bid ranks between 100 and 105 and Zwabber between 125 and 130 when there are four or more players in the game.\nSome players allow bids of Zwabber with Roem, ranking immediately above Zwabber without Roem.\nPlay\nSome do not allow undertrumping, unless the player has nothing but trumps. That is, if a non-trump suit is led and has already been trumped, you not allowed to play a lower trump unless your hand consists entirely of trumps.\nSome play that in Misre with a single declarer, the declarer must choose a trump suit when leading to the first trick. When there is more than one declarer, Misre is played without trumps as usual.\nScoring\nSome award only 100 points rather than 200 for a six-card sequence.\nSome play with point scoring rather than pluses and minuses. In one version, each player begins with 5 points, and the aim is to get to zero. A successful declarer deducts one point for a bid of less than 50, 2 points for a bid of at least 50 but less than 75, and 3 points for a bid of 75 or more. An unsuccessful declarer adds the relevant number of points. A player who reaches or passes zero has won and drops out of the game; a player who reaches or passes 11 is the loser; if no one gets to 11, the last player left in when everyone else has reached or passed zero is the loser.\nAnother version, briefly described to me by Eefje Limpt-Bogmans, is played as follows:\n\nOnly 5 cards are dealt to each player, with two [face up?] in the centre.\nThere are no Misre or Zwabber bids - only numbers, Boonhaak, Boonhaak with Roem and Open Boonhaak, which is highest.\nThe minimum number bid is 25. If you have bid a number you cannot increase your bid to a Boonhaak of any sort.\nEveryone starts with 5 points; a player who has less than 1 is out (i.e. drops out of the game and cannot lose); a player who has 10 or more points [or the last player left in if no one reaches 10] is the loser.\nBids 25-45 score 1 point; 50-70 score 2 points; 75-95 score 3 points; 100-120 score 5 points; 125 or more score 6 points; Boonhaak scores 5 points; Open Boonhaak scores 10 points (i.e. results in winning or losing the game).\nIn Boonhaak and Open Boonhaak, the declarer is not allowed to take the centre cards. [Open Boonhaak is presumably a bid in which declarer must win all five tricks with exposed cards.]\nOther Boonaken Web Sites\nThe Netherlands Open Bonaken Championship is held annually at the Caf Keizer in Leimuiden.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Ace-Ten Games > Marriage Group > Jass group > Boonaken\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2003.

It has very strict playing rules and a\n  scoring method that makes it very interesting for deductive players and\n  allows usually worthless cards to have an important role in the results.\n  It is closely related to Manilla from which it takes the mechanics,\n  but the rules enforce logical play and minimise the effects of luck.\n  \nContents\n\nThe aim\nThe deck\nCard values\nThe deal\nSelecting trumps\nPlaying\nRules of play\nParlett notation\nVariants\nChampionships\nThe computer program\nOther web sites\n\nThe Aim\nBotifarra is a point trick game for four players in fixed partnerships;\nas usual you sit opposite your partner. Only the points in the tricks are\nimportant, not the number of tricks, although a trick also has a value\nby itself.\n\nThe game is usually played until one team reaches 101 points or more,\nand this requires several hands. As in other four-player games, it is a\nwidespread practice to play three games, so that each player partners each\nof the three others for one game.\n\nThe Deck\nBotifarra is played with a standard Spanish 48 card deck of four suits: coins (oros), cups (copes), swords (espases) and batons (bastons) running from 1 to 12.\n\nIn each suit the 10\nis called Sota (Jack), the 11Cavall (Horse) and the 12Rei (King).\n\nCard values and scoring\nThe card order from highest to lowest is 9, Ace, King, Horse, Jack, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. In this game the 9 is called Manilla. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 9 is worth 5 points, Ace 4 points, King 3 points, Horse 2 points, Jack 1 point. Each trick is worth also 1 point. That makes a total of 72 points in a hand. A team that makes more than 36 points scores the excess towards the game. This score can be doubled in some cases as will be explained later. Example: if you take 45 card points in a hand you would score 9 points towards the game, 18 if doubled, 36 if redoubled, etc.\n\nThe deal\n\nThe dealer deals the whole deck counterclockwise, four cards at a time,\nbeginning with the player to his right. After each hand the turn to deal\npasses to the right. Usually the dealer\'s right hand opponent shuffles\nand the left hand opponent cuts.\n\nSelecting trumps\n\nThe dealer selects trumps simply by choosing the suit he wants, or he selects Botifarra\n(no trumps), or he passes this right to his partner. If the dealer passes, the partner must choose a suit or No trumps - he cannot pass the right to choose.\n\nAfter trumps are selected, either of the members of the other team,\nthe defenders, can double (Contrar) the hand if they want to. Either\nof the members of the dealer\'s team can, if doubled, redouble (Recontrar)\nthe hand. Again, and last, the defenders can re-redouble (Sant Vicens).\n\nThe score for Botifarra (no trump) games is doubled in any case, and Contrar,\nRecontrar and Sant Vicens can double it further, so there could be up to 4\ndoubles in total. \n\nWhen doubling, the players speak in anticlockwise rotation. So the order in which the players have the opportunity to double is:\n\nContrar: first the player to the right of the one who chose trumps; then the player to the trump maker\'s left;\nRecontrar: first player to the doubler\'s right; then the player to the doubler\'s left;\nSant Vicens: first the to the redoubler\'s right; then the player to the redoubler\'s left.\n\nPlaying\n\nBotifarra is played anticlockwise. The player to the right of the dealer\nleads to the first trick, and the winner of each trick begins the next\none. The completed tricks are stored face down in front of one of the members\nof each team. Completed tricks cannot be consulted, except for the most\nrecent one.\n\nEach trick is won by the highest trump played to it, or if no trump\nis played, by the highest card of the suit led.\n\nThe rules of play\n\nAny card may be led. When playing to a trick, the rules, in decreasing\norder of precedence, are:\n\nYou must play a card of the suit led if you have one;\nIf your partner is not already winning the trick, you must play a card that beats the cards already played to the trick, if you can. This includes trumping or overtrumping if you can not follow suit. Obviously, the second player never has a winning partner, so he must always try to win.\nIf you play a card which does not beat all those already played to the trick, either because you cannot, or because your partner is winning and you do not want to beat your partner\'s card, your choice of play is restricted as follows:\n\nif your partner is winning you must play either a counting card (10, 11, 12, 1 or 9) or the lowest card you have in the suit you play;\nif the opponents are winning you must play the lowest card you have of the suit you play. Exception: if you are playing second to the trick and you cannot follow suit, you are allowed to play a counting card (in the hope that your partner will win the trick).\n\nRule 3 is what makes deduction interesting and should be carefully understood. Playing your lowest card when you are not winning the trick or giving points to your partner is natural, but in this game it is also mandatory. You can not "bluff" by playing a different card, and the other players can make deductions about your remaining cards from the fact that you had to play your lowest card.\n\nAccording to Parlett notation, and with the addition of:\n\nx0 meaning the lowest of suit x, and\nxv meaning a value card (10, 11, 12, 1 or 9) of suit x,\n\nthe rules can be formulated as follows:\n\nIf your partner is winning: Ff0fv , Tt0tvr0rv\nIf your partner is not winning:\n\n2nd player: F , f0 , T , r0rv\n3rd & 4th players: F , f0 , T , t0r0\n\n\nVariants\nEastern and western versions\n\nTwo main forms of the game exist, the western one and the eastern one. The version described above is the eastern one, which has stricter rules of play. In the western form, only rules 1 and 2 apply, but not 3. So in the western form, if your partner is currently winning the trick or the opponents are winning and you are unable to beat their cards, you are under no restrictions except that of following suit if possible.\n\nThis \'small\' difference leads in fact to two different styles of playing. The eastern version allows greater scope for deduction, so it could be called more scientific. The western one has greater freedom, so it allows more imaginative playing.\n\nEach version has passionate advocates, and both versions have their own attraction. It is only important that the players should agree which version of the rules is in force before starting a game.\n\nFor beginners we would suggest the eastern version, because if you start by learning the more restrictives rule it will be relatively easy to relax them later if desired. It would be more difficult to introduce the restrictions later, having first learned the game without them. \n\nVariations within the eastern rules of play\n\nThere is a widespread variation of of the eastern version in which the exception to rule 3.2 applies also when following suit. So as second player you can play a counting card of the suit led in the hope that your partner in fourth position will win. The Parlett notation for the second player would then be F , f0fv , T , r0rv.\n\nAnother variant of the eastern rules is occasionally played. If you are the third player and your partner is winning, you may play a counting card instead of your lowest one, provided that your partner\'s card is "safe" - that is, all the higher cards should have been played previously or you must hold them. This version is played only in a small area, and tends to cause disputes with players familiar with other versions. Also players of this version do not entirely agree when a lead can be counted as "safe". Therefore this variant is not recommended.  \n\nDoubling variations\n\nThe double score for Botifarra seems to be widely used, but the multiples used for the other "doubles" (Contrar, Recontrar, Sant Vicens) can be almost any reasonable combination. Instead of the 2-4-8 scheme, 2-3-5 or 2-4-10 can be used. The values you use should be agreed before playing. They do not modify the way to play, they just change how good your cards need to be to double as it can be more or less dangerous than in the normal scheme.\n\nScoring variation\n\nWhen playing a series of games against the same opponents, some players carry over any points in excess of 101 to begin the following game. This discourages a losing team from doubling without good cards just because their opponents are very near to 101 and likely to win in any case.\n\nExample. The score is 95-40. The second team double because they are unlikely to overtake the first team before the first team reach 101 unless a lucky hand occurs. In fact they lose by 10 points (46-36), so under this variation the game score becomes (95+10*2) 115-40 and the game ends. The new game will begin with a score 14-0. Without the double the new game would have begun at 4-0.\n\nChampionships\n\nIn official championships in Catalonia a duplicate mode of play is used, in which the same hands are played in all the tables, each team playing 4 hands against each other team.\n\nEach hand is therefore played several times over, with a different pairs holding the same North-South cards and East-West cards on each occasion. The overall score is worked out by comparing the results of all the teams who held the N-S cards, and separately comparing the results obtained with the E-W cards. The pair who achieved the best result as N-S with that particular deal scores 2 points and the pair who achieved the worst result scores 1 point. All the other pairs who played the same cards as N-S receive a score between 1 and 2, in proportion to their result. The formula for scoring is 1+(points-minimum)/(maximum-minimum). The E-W results are also compared and scored in the same way. \n\nA team that breaks the rules of play is penalised with a score of 0 for that hand. The opposing team receives the average of score of the other teams that played that hand with the same cards.  \n\nDoubles are only scored by the team that announces them, so a Botifarra or Double only scores double to the team that makes it, and a doubled Botifarra scores double - not quadruple - to both sides. Redouble is only informational and does not affect the score. Re-redouble is not allowed.\n\nThe following table is an example from a championship with 6 tables. It shows the results for one particular deal in which E-W made trumps. It can be seen than team K chose Botifarra, and that teams C and F doubled.\n\n\nN-SE-WHand score\nBotifarraDoubleN/SE/W\nFinal scoreN-SFinal scoreE-W\nTeam ATeam H37-35\n..+1-1\n1.771.44\nTeam BTeam I35-37\n..-1+1\n1.681.56\nTeam CTeam J28-44\n.X-16+8\n1.002.00\nTeam DTeam K40-32\nB.+4-8\n1.911.00\nTeam ETeam L42-30\n..+6-6\n2.001.13\nTeam FTeam M30-42\n.X-12+6\n1.181.88\n\n\nExample of computing final score.

Up to 13 can take part using a standard 52 card pack; more if two or more packs are used. The players sit in a circle, and are dealt four cards each. The object is to collect four cards of the same rank, by passing cards one at a time to your left-hand neighbour while receiving cards from the player to your right.\nThere are two different ways of playing: with or without a stock pile. There are also two different ways to end each hand: in Pig the players touch their noses, while in Spoons they grab a token from a central stock which contains one fewer token than there are players.\nNormally the loser of each hand loses a life, though in some versions they are eliminated immediately. In the versions with lives, each life lost gives the player a letter of a word, and players drop out when they complete the word. The word usually corresponds to the name of the game, so in Pig, each player has three lives while in Donkey they have six.\nPig with no stock pile\nThis version of the game requires four cards of one rank for each person playing. For example, with seven players you could use all the aces, kings, queens, jacks, tens, nines and eights from a standard pack (28 cards). With four you could just use the aces, kings, queens and jacks (16 cards). The cards are shuffled and dealt out to the players so that everyone has four cards.\nAll players simultaneously place one unwanted card face down to their left, and then pick up the card that the player to their right has placed. Then they do the same again, and continue until someone collects four of a kind. There are no turns - the passing happens as fast as the players wish, but during the play cards must only be passed one at a time, and you must never have more than four cards in your hand at one time, so you are not allowed to pick up a new card from your right-hand neighbour until you have reduced your cards to three by discarding one to your left.\nIf you manage to collect four of a kind you do not say anything. Instead you quietly touch the end of your nose with your index finger, and stay in that position. As soon as one player touches his or her nose, all the other players may do the same, even if they do not have four of a kind themselves. The last player to touch his or her nose loses. It is surprising how players will sometimes continue to study their cards for quite a long time, not noticing that everyone else is touching their noses.\nMany play that the loser now drops out of the game, and the next deal is played with one fewer player - of course four cards of one rank must be removed from the pack each time a player drops out. When there are only two players left, they are the joint winners.\nFor a longer game, you can give everyone three lives. Players only drop out when they have lost three times. The lives can be represented by letters of the word PIG: the first time you lose you get a \'P\', the second time an \'I\', and the third time a \'G\', and you drop out. Some play that it is illegal to talk to a PIG - that is, someone who has lost three lives. Anyone who does so becomes a PIG themselves. This gives the players who have been knocked out something to do - they can distract the surviving players and try to persude them to talk to them.\nIn Australia the game is sometimes called Hog rather than Pig. The loser of each deal is the Pig, and a player who has been a Pig three times becomes a Hog and drops out of the game.\nPig with a stock pile\nThis version is played with a full pack of 52 cards, or more than one pack if there are more than 12 players. Four cards are dealt to each player and the remaining stock of undealt cards is placed to the right of the dealer.\nThe game is played in the same way as the version without a stock, described above, except that the dealer draws cards from the stock, and the player to dealer\'s right placed unwanted cards face down on a discard pile. The rule that you can never hold more than four cards at a time still holds, and you can only discard and draw one card at a time. The dealer can discard cards and draw replacements from the stock as fast as he or she likes. The other players are restricted only by the speed at which the player before them passes on cards. When the stock is exhausted the discard pile is used as a new stock.\nThe object of the game is the same as in the game without a stock - to collect four of a kind. The first player to collect four of a kind touches his or her nose, and the other players then do the same, the last to do so being the loser. There is a slight advantage in dealing in this version of the game, since as dealer you don\'t have to wait for your right-hand neighbour to discard. Therefore it is usually agreed that the winner of each hand (the first to collect four of a kind) deals the next.\nAs in the game without a stock, the loser may be eliminated from the game; alternatively the loser may lose a life, players who lose three lives being eliminated. It is not necessary to adjust the deck as players leave the game, and it is possible to play for a single winner, who is the first to collect four of a kind when only two players remain.\n\nVariations\nSome players deal five cards each rather than four. The cards are still passed one at a time and the aim is to collect four of a kind among your five cards. Others deal only three cards each, and the aim is then to collect three of a kind.\n\nSpoons\nFor this game, in addition to cards and people, you need a collection of spoons, with one fewer spoon than the number of players. The spoons are placed in the centre of the circle of players and the cards are dealt and played the same way as in Pig - the game can be played either with a stock or without a stock.\nA player who collects four of a kind takes one of the spoons. As soon as a spoon has been taken, all the other players are entitled to take a spoon each, even if they do not have four of a kind. Since there is one spoon fewer than the number of players, one player will be left without a spoon. This player is the loser of this deal.\nA series of deals can be played in which the loser, or a player who has lost three times, is eliminated from the game. Each time a player is eliminated you must remove one spoon from the game; if playing without a stock you also remove one set of four equal cards from the pack.\nThere are more dangerous versions of this game known as Forks and Knives, using those utensils instead of spoons.\nVatra and Magarac\n Vatra (Fire) and Magarac (Jackass) are versions of Pig without a stock that are played in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The basic game is similar to the game above, except that players pass cards in turn rather than simultaneously. There is also a somewhat more challenging variant that is played an extra "travelling card". \nThe basic game is for 3 to 13 players using a deck of  4 cards of the same rank for each player: for example 4 players will use 16 cards, and you would use the full 52 card deck for 13 players. The players sit in a circle and the randomly chosen dealer shuffles and deals all the cards, clockwise one at a time, so that each player has four. Player to the left of the dealer begins the game by passing one card to the left. Each player in clockwise order, after receiving a card from the right, checks to see whether he has four-of-a-kind, and if not passes one card to the left. Any card may be passed, including the card the player just received. So the player to dealer\'s left has four cards during his turn and three cards otherwise, while the other players have five cards during their turn and four cards otherwise. he then must choose one of his cards and pass it to the player on his left, face down. \nA  player who has four-of-a-kind may inmmediately anounce it by  laying or slamming his hand (meaning both the cards and the hand holding them) onto the playing surface and yelling "Vatra!" ("Fire!"). Once this has happened, all other players must do the same thing as soon as they can: the last player to do this is the loser of the hand. Note that a player must put his hand down and yell "Fire!" to be safe from losing, doing just one thing but not the other doesn\'t count. The loser of the hand is punished as described below, and the turn to deal passes to the left.\nThe Travelling Card\nThe travelling card is an extra card that is added to the deck. Usually it is the 7 of diamonds but if the four sevens are in play some other odd card can be used, for example a joker. The deal will now end with the player to dealer\'s left, who will have five cards at the start. Before play begins, the holder of the travelling card must turn it around  so  all the other players can see it and know where it started. The travelling card is then turned back facing its owner, who then shuffles his cards  under the table or behind his back.\nAs in the basic game, the player to dealer\'s left begins. Playera will have four cards except during their turn, after receiving a card and before passing one on, when they will have five. When a card is passed, the player to whom it is given can refuse it, provided that he has not yet seen what it is: the player to his right must in that case pass a different card, which cannot be refused.  \n If a player manages to complete a four-of-a-kind, but his fifth card is the travelling card, then that player cannot yell "Fire!" and win. Instead he must pass a card. If he succeeds in passing the travelling card (either immediately or after his first offer is refused), keeping only his four-of-a-kind, he can then yell "Fire!" and win. \nPunishment\n The two versions of the game, Vatra and Magarac, differ according to how the loser is punished.\nIn Magarac, the loser of each hand gets one letter of the word Magarac (which means Jackass, which conveniently also has 7 letters). The game continues until a player has lost   7 times, spelling out the  whole word. This player loses the whole game and  is mockingly called jackass by other players.\nVatra uses a more authentic  form of punishment, but is usually only played by young boys. One of the players gathers up the cards and shuffles them and another player, usually the winner of the hand, is chosen to issue the punishment. The loser names one of the cards in the deck  (other than the travelling card), stating its rank and suit, and also chooses whether to begin from the top or the bottom of the deck. The player who shuffled takes cards one by one from the top or bottom as specified by the loser and shows them, continuing until the card selected by the loser appears. Meanwhile the loser places his hand palm down on the table. Each card that appears, up to and excluding the named card, results in a punishment according to its suit:\n\n Spade - The punisher hits the loser\'s hand with his  fist, like a hammer. (The punisher should not hit with his knuckles, because there is then a risk of  breaking bones).\n Club - The punisher runs his knuckles over the loser\'s hand twice in the shape of a cross.\n Diamond - The punisher twists the skin on the back of the loser\'s hand.\n Heart - The punisher pats the loser\'s hand as one  would pat a dog or a cat.\n\nWhen the loser\'s  card comes up, his punishment is over and the new hand is dealt. \nSome Tips\nIf you have good reflexes, keep your eyes and ears open for a player yelling "Fire!" and react  quickly enough you will never lose, but there are plenty of other things you can do to improve your chances.\n\nTo maximise your prospects of collecting  four-of-a-kind, never pass a card that\'s part of a pair unless your other 3 cards are a three-of-a-kind.\nObserve whether the player to your left keeps the card you give him or passes it on.  You will then know whether he wants the cards of that rank or not.\nIn a 3 or 4 player game it is possible to collect one card of each rank, making it impossible for other players to win.\nIf playing with a travelling card, watch your opponents closely, and you may be able to guess from their behaviour where the travelling card is.\nWhen playing with a travelling card, sometimes it is worth refusing the first card you are offered if you know the travelling card is not to your right. This may force your right-hand opponent to give you a card that he wanted to keep.\nIf you lose when playing Vatra, it is worth watching carefully as  the cards are gathered and shuffled: you might be able to estimate the position of a certain card. Do not choose a heart, since the card you choose does not cause a punishment, and so you would as many as possible of the cards before your card to be hearts.\nIf you are the winner or punisher, do not be too agressive: players who hit the losing player really hard usually get hit hard themselves in return when they lose.\n\nOther variations and web pages\nThe French equivalent of Spoons known as Bouchon (meaning cork) is played with corks. The loser of each hand gets a letter of the word B-O-U-C-H-O-N, so you are not eliminated until you have lost six times.\nIn Australia, Donkey is a game similar to Spoons played without a stock but with 5-card hands, so that a player who has 4-of a kind can continue playing after surreptitiously claiming a token. As you would expect, the loser of each hand gets a letter of the word D-O-N-K-E-Y. It is described on Adrian Morgan\'s Donkey page.\nThe Romanian version Popa Prostul is played without a stock pile but with an extra card, a joker called Popa Prostul. The dealer begins with five cards of which he immediately discards one to the left, and the other players with four each. Subsequently players must not hold more than four cards - they must always discard one to the left before picking up the one passed from their right. A player who picks up the joker must keep it for one turn, passing a different card, before passing the joker on after picking up the next card. A player who has four of a kind puts his cards face down after which everyone does the same, the last to do so being the loser.\nAcknowledgement\nMy thanks to the many people who sent me descriptions of these games, including Kerry Allemann, Craig Daniel, Chris Davis, Karen Emery, Keith Forrest, Peter Foster, Garnell, Lisa Gartland, Daniel Grad, Carla Jean, Yale Kozinski, Doris Leung, Brian Lipinski, Veselko Kelava, Dean Morbeck, Adrian Morgan, Rob O\'Keefe, Evan Parsley, Doughy Satan, Alan Stevenson, Steven Wyckoff and several anonymous correspondents.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Card Passing Games > Pig, Spoons\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2003, 2008, 2013.

In the course of the late ninteenth and early twentieth century it was supplanted by the newly fashionable game of Poker.\nBouillotte was introduced at the time of the French Revolution as a regulated form of the popular game Brelan, which had been played since the seventeenth century. Brelan was a vying game in which from two to five players received three cards each from a pack of 24, 28, 32, or 36 cards, and the next card was turned from stock. As in Bouillotte, the best hand was a brelan carr, being four of a kind made with the aid of the turned card, followed by a simple brelan or three of a kind. When no one had three of a kind the winning hand was that with the highest card of the suit of which post points were in play.\nThe following description of Bouillotte is based on my understanding of the accounts in the following books: Friedrich Anton: Encyclopdie der Spiele (Leipzig, 1889), E. Lanes: Nouveau Manuel Complet des Jeux de Cartes (Paris, 1912), Jean Quinola: Nouvelle Acadmie des Jeux (Paris, 1893) and R.F Foster: Comprehensive Handbook to the Card Games (London, 1897).\nPlayers and Cards\nThe standard game is for four players, using a 20-card pack with the cards in each suit ranking from high to low A-K-Q-9-8.\nIt is possible for five people to play, adding the Jacks, which rank just below the Queens, to make a 24-card pack. Three can play using a 16-card pack without the Queens.\nEach player starts with an equal supply of chips, known as the cave. Your bets are restricted by what you have left in your cave. Only when you have lost all your chips are you allowed to \'buy in\', obtaining a new cave to continue playing. The monetary value of a chip and the number of chips in the cave (for example 100) are to be agreed before the game starts.\nTo choose seats, a card of each rank from the King down is taken from the pack. These cards are shuffled and each player draws one. The player who draws a King chooses a seat, and then the holders of the other cards take the other seats in counter-clockwise order around the table, in descending order of the cards they drew.\nInitial Stakes and Deal\nDeal and play are counter-clockwise.\nBefore the deal, the players must place an initial bet in the pot, equivalent to the ante in poker. Some authors specify an ante of 1 chip, placed by the dealer only. Others say that each player puts in 1 chip, and the dealer adds an extra chip (to make an initial pot of 5 chips in the four-player game).\nThe player to the dealer\'s right can now increase the size of the pot, by adding an amount equal to what it already contains. This is equivalent to a straddle or blind bet in poker. In French Bouillotte this blind bet was known as a carre. If the player to dealer\'s right straddles, the next player to the right can also straddle by doubling the pot again (contre-carre), and so on round to the dealer. If a player at his turn chooses not to straddle, or does not have enough chips to do so, this ends the straddling and the cards must be dealt.\nThe last straddler will have the advantage of being the last to act in the betting after the deal. This player thus has the advantage of waiting to see what the other players do, winning the pot if they all pass, and having the possibility of raising after finding out which of them are prepared to match his blind bet.\nSome play that if the first and second players both straddle, the first player can  buy back the right to bet last by doubling the pot again. Only if the first player does not want to buy back does the right to straddle pass to the third player, and if the third player then straddles the second player can buy back by doubling the pot.\nAfter the straddling phase has finished, the dealer deals the cards one at a time, until each player has three cards, and turns the next card face up.\nBetting\nThe players now bet on who has the best hand (see ranking of hands below). If no one straddled, the betting begins with the player to the right of dealer. If one or more players straddled, the player to the right of the final straddler is the first to bet. The first player can either pass, betting no money but reserving the right to enter the betting later, or open the betting. To open you must place at least enough chips in the pot so that your stake at least equals that of the player who has stakes most - this will be the final straddler or the dealer if no one straddled. So for example, if you play ther version where everyone places an initial bet or one chip before the deal and the dealer adds a second ship, the the player to dealer\'s right could open for one chip, making this player\'s stake up to 2, the same amount staked by the dealer. If the player to dealer\'s right straddled, by adding an extra 5 chips to the pot, then the next player would need to put in at least 5 chips to open. You can open for more than the minimum amount if you want to, placing anything up to your entire supply of chips, which is announced by saying \'va-tout\'.\nIf the first player passes, the next player has the same options, and so on around the table. If there was no straddle and all four players pass, the cards are thrown in, the deal passes to the next player, the chips in the pot remain, and the dealer adds another chip. If three players pass after a straddle, the final straddler collects the pot, which includes the initial bets of the players, plus any previous straddles.\nIf a player opens, the subsequent players in turn, including any who passed before the opening, must now choose whether to call (tenir), by placing enough chips to bring their stake up to the same level as the player who openend, to raise (relancer) by staking a greater number of chips than are required to call, or to fold (filer), dropping out of the betting and abandoning whatever money they have already staked. After a straddle, if a player opens for the minimum amount and no one raises, the straddler can of course call without placing any further chips, but is allowed to raise instead. Once the betting hads been opened it is no longer possible to pass and reserve the right to bet later.\nIf the opening is raised, the betting continues around the table, omitting any players who have already folded, each player choosing whether to call, raise or fold. This continues until one of the following situations is reached:\n\nAll but one of the players have folded. In this case the last surviving player automatically wins the pot.\nAll but two players have folded. When there are only two surviving players, any subsequent call ends the betting phase and there is a showdown between these two players to decide who wins the pot.\nThe opening or final raise has been called by all the surviving players, but there were more than two players still in the game at the time when the call was made. This does not end the betting. The turn now passes to the first surviving player to the right of the player who opened or most recently raised. This player is allowed to raise the stake again by placing extra chips, and the betting continues as before. If this first player passes, the next player in trun has a chance to raise, and so on around the table.\n\nIt follows that a showdown between three or more players occurs only after the last bet (or opening) has been called by all the other players in turn, and then all these other players in turn have passed their opportunity to raise the stake again. At this point, the player who opened or most recently raised is not allowed to raise again. Instead there is a showdown between all the surviving players.\nAll the above is based on the assumption that everyone has an adequate supply of chips. A player who does not have enough chips left to meet the minimum required bet is not allowed to open or raise, but can call by placing all his remaining chips. At this point the pot is divided into two. The first part contains a number of chips from each player which is not more than the number of chips staked by the player who has all his chips in the pot. Any excess is placed in the second part. For example if the stakes of the four players are 2, 5, 8 and 16, and the 5 chips are all that the second player had, then the first pot will contain 17 chips (2 + 5 + 5 + 5) and the second pot will contain the remaining 14 chips (3 + 11).  The player who has no chips left can only win the first pot; the other surviving players compete for the second pot.\nRanking of Hands\nThe players look at their cards. In the standard game there are three possible types of hand.\nThe highest is the Brelan Carr: three cards of the same rank as the turned up card (for example, three Nines when a Nine is turned up).\nNext highest is an ordinary Brelan - a hand of three cards of the same rank, different from the turned up card (for example three Kings when a Nine is turned up). If more than one player has a Brelan, the highest wins, the cards ranking in descending order A, K, Q, 9, 8.\nIf no one has a Brelan Carr or Brelan, the winning hand is determined as follows. The hands of the four players are exposed, and the total points showing in each suit are counted, using the values Ace=11, King=10, Queen=10, Nine=9, Eight=8. The winning suit is the suit with most points showing, and the winning hand is the hand containing the highest card of that suit belonging to any player who has not folded during the betting.\nSome care is needed to resolve a case where two or more points show equally many points. Next, it must be determined to which player each of the tieing suits belongs. Considering only the players who have not folded, the owner of a suit is the surviving player who holds the highest card in it. The winning player will then be the first of the surviving players in counter-clockwise order, starting to dealer\'s right, who owns one of the suits that tied for most points.\nExample: Player D is the dealer and the others in order are A, B, C. The turned card is A\n\n\nPlayer A: A 9 8 (folded)\nPlayer B: Q A 8\nPlayer C: K Q A\nPlayer D: K 8  Q (folded)\n\nHearts and diamonds each have 39 points. If A had stayed in, diamonds would have won, but as things stand, with A having folded, B wins on position as the owner of the heart suit.\nShowdown and Payment\nWhen there is a showdown, all players, including those who have dropped out of the betting, show their cards, and the winning hand (among those players who have not dropped out) is determined according to the ranking of hands. The winner collects the contents of the pot. In addition, anyone who had a Brelan Carr is paid two chips by each opponent, including those who dropped out of the betting, and anyone who has an ordinary Brelan is paid one chip by each opponent, including those who dropped out. If two players have ordinary Brelans, they do not have to pay each other (their payments cancel), but the higher ranked Brelan beats the lower for the purpose of deciding who wins the pot.\nWhen the pot is split because a player ran out of chips during the betting, the first pot is settled first among all the players who have not dropped out, including the one who bet all his chips. The winning suit is determined by this first pot: when players who have contributed to the second pot compete for it, the winner (in the absence of Brelans) will be whichever of them holds the highest card of this winning suit.\nVariations\nThe books mention many variations. For example, the amount of chips each player began within their cave and the amount staked before each deal varied.\nSome recognised the Brelan de Mistigri consisting of the Queen of Clubs with two cards of the same rank and colour - for example Q-9-9. This ranked lower than an ordinary Brelan but higher than a hand winning on points. On the other hand some high stakes players did not recognise any Brelans at all, the best hand on points winning always.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Showdown games > Vying Games > Bouillotte\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2005.

However, there are several differences in scoring and other details.\nPlayers and Cards\nThe four players are divided into two teams of 2 players, partners sitting across from each other. \nThere are 32 cards (8 cards in each of the 4 suits hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades).\n  The ranking of the cards within each suit and the point values of cards when taken in tricks are as follows:\n\n\n\nTrump suit\nOther suits\n\n\nJack\n20 points\nAce\n11 points\n\n\nNine\n14 points\nTen\n10 points\n\n\nAce\n11 points\nKing\n4 points\n\n\nTen\n10 points\nQueen\n3 points\n\n\nKing\n4 points\nJack\n2 points\n\n\nQueen\n3 points\nNine\n0 points\n\n\nEight\n0 points\nEight\n0 points\n\n\nSeven\n0 points\nSeven\n0 points\n\n\nDeal and selecting trumps\nDeal and play are clockwise and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The dealer shuffles and the player to dealer\'s right cuts.\nThe dealer deals five cards to each player, one at a time, and turns the next card face up to show the proposed trump suit. The player left to the dealer may accept this suit as trumps on behalf of his team or pass. If he passes, the dealer\'s partner has the same options, then the player to dealer\'s right and finally the dealer. If all four pass, there is another round in which each player in turn can name any suit of his choice as trumps. (In the second round any of the four suits can be chosen - even the suit of the face up card, which was rejected the first time. This is one of the differences from French Belote.) If all four players pass again, the cards are thrown in and the deal passes to the next player\nWhen a trump suit has been chosen, if anyone holds the seven of the same suit as the face up card, they may take the face up card in exchange for the seven. The deal is then completed: the dealer  gives a further three cards to each player, one at a time, taking the face up card as the final card that he deals to himself. \nMelds\nBefore play begins, each player in turn, starting to the left of the dealer, may declare and show any melds (scoring card combinations) that he has in his hand. The possible melds are as follws:\n\n\nMeld\nScore\nNotes\n\n\nSequence of 3 cards\n20 points\nSequences must consist of consecutive cards of a suit. For this purpose  cards rank in the order A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in all suits. So for example Q-J-10-9 is a valid 4-card sequence, even in trumps, but A-10-K is not a valid sequence.\n\n\nSequence of 4 cards\n50 points\n\n\nSequence of 5 cards\n100 points\n\n\nFour of a kind\n100 points\nFour cards of the same rank, such as Q-Q-Q-Q or 7-7-7-7\n\n\nKing and Queen of trumps\n20 points\nThis is known as "mpourlotto"\n\n\nNote that there are several differences here from French Belote. All melds belonging to both teams are counted: it does not matter which team has the best meld, only which has more points overall including those taken in the play. All fours of a kind score 100, even eights and sevens, and there is no special score for four jacks or four nines.\nPlay\nPlay starts with the player to the left from the dealer and proceeds clockwise. The starting player leads any card from his hand. Other players must follow suit if possible. If unable to follow suit they must play a trump. A player who has no cards of the suit led and no trumps may play any card.\nSubject to the above rules, each player must if possible play a card that beats the best card so far played to the trick.That is, if able to follow suit you must beat the highest card of the suit so far played, unless someone has already trumped. If you have no sufficiently high card or the trick is trumped you must still follow suit and may play any card of the suit. When trumping you must beat all the trumps already played if possible; if unable to play a winning trump you may play any trump. But see variations. \nThe player of the highest ranking trump, or if no trumps are played the highest card of the suit that was led, wins the trick and leads any card to the next trick. This process continues until all cards have been played. \nScoring\nEach team counts the points that it has won:\n\nall the melds that they declared before the play\nthe value of all the cards in the tricks that they won\nthe winners of the last trick score 10 points extra, or 90 points if the other team took no tricks at all ("capo").\n\nTo check the calculation it is useful to know that the total number of points in the game excluding melds is 152 points, provided that each team wins at least one trick. Winning all the tricks is worth 232 points plus any melds.\nIf the team that chose trumps scores more points than their opponents, then each team adds the points that they took to their cumulative score. If the points are equal, or the trump makers\' opponents have more, all the points are scored by their opponents. That is, the opponents of the trump makers score 152 points plus the value of all the melds declared by both teams. This is known as "mesa".\nThe team that first reaches a cumulative total of 1000 points wins the game. If both teams reach 1000 points in the same deal, the team with more points wins. If the scores are equal and more than 1000, two more deals are played to decide the winners.\nVariations\nSome play that if your partner is currently winning the trick, you are not obliged to beat his card, though you must still follow suit if able to. This less strict rule is common in caf games.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Ace-Ten Games > Marriage Group > Jass group > Mpourloto\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2010.

Although it is a trick-taking game unrelated to Poker, it has become known to Poker players in North America as an alternative choice in home Poker games. The game is of French origin. It is a descendant of Bourre, a three-card game which was popular in southwest France in the early 20th century, which was probably descended in turn from the Spanish game Burro ("donkey"). In the French game a player who plays and takes no tricks is said to be "bourr", and it is this term that gives its name to the Louisiana game Bourr, which is sometimes spelled with just one \'r\': (bour). Sometimes this is altered to "bourre" or "boure" by American writers unfamiliar with French accents, and often it is written "booray" or "boo-ray" which in American spelling approximates the French pronunciation of bourr.\nThe information on this page relies heavily on the book Bour by Roy J Nickens (Baton Rouge, 1972) as well as correspondence from John May, Brad Duhon, Victoria Diemer and others.\nPlayers and Cards\nThe game is best for seven players. In theory any number from two to eight can play, but with fewer than about five players the game becomes less interesting.\nA standard international 52-card pack without jokers is used. The cards of each suit rank from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2.\nAnte and Deal\nBefore the first deal each player must contribute an ante of one chip to the pot. Before subsequent deals, certain players may not have to pay an ante, depending on the result of the previous hand - see below.\nAny player who wishes to may shuffle and the dealer has the right to shuffle last. The cards must then be cut by the player to dealer\'s right.\nThe dealer deals out the cards one at a time, starting with the player to dealer\'s left and continuing clockwise until each player has five cards. Cards are dealt face down, except for the dealer\'s fifth and last card, which is dealt face up. The suit of this card indicates the trump suit.\nThe turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nDraw or Pass\nPlayers pick up their cards and look at them, but may not show their cards to anyone else.\nBeginning with the player to dealer\'s left, each player in clockwise order must declare whether he or she will pass or play, and if playing, how many cards he or she wishes to discard.\nIf you pass, you stack your cards face down in front of you.and take no further part in the play of the hand. You can no longer win the pot on that deal, nor can you lose any additional chips.\nIf you play, you may discard some of your cards face down, announcing how many you are discarding. The dealer then deals you an equal number of replacement cards from the undealt part of the deck. You may discard your whole hand of five cards if you wish to, or if you are happy with your original cards you may stand pat and play with the hand you were dealt, discarding nothing.\nIt may happen, especially in an eight-player game, that the dealer runs out of cards to deal before all the players who wish to play have been served with replacements for their discards. In that case the dealer gathers up all the discarded cards and passed hands from the players who have already acted (but not the discards of the player who is currently being served). These cards are shuffled and cut and used to continue dealing cards to replace any remaining discards.\nIf the turned up trump card is an ace, the dealer must play. There is no risk in doing so since the ace of trumps always wins a trick.\nIf only one player elects to play, all the others passing, the lone player is deemed to have won all five tricks by default, and this player therefore collects the whole pot without playing out any cards. If all players other than the dealer pass, the dealer should of course play and collect the pot.\nYou should be careful not to make any premature announcement or gesture indicating whether you intend to play or pass or how many cards you might discard, before it is your turn to act. The penalty is to forfeit your next turn to deal.\nThe Play\nThe player to dealer\'s left, or if this player has passed, the next player in clockwise rotation who is playing, leads to the first trick. Thereafter the winner of each trick leads to the next.\nA card is led by placing it face up in the centre of the table. Each of the other active players (those who have not passed) in clockwise order must also play a card face up in the centre. When all have played a card, the trick is complete. It is won by whoever played the highest card of the trump suit, or if no trump was played, by whoever played the highest card of the suit that was led.\nThe play of the cards is governed by strict rules.\n\nPlayers must always "follow suit" if able to - that is, all but the first to play to a trick must play a card of the same suit as the card that was led.\nAny player who is unable to follow suit, having no card of the suit that was led, must play a trump if able to.\nSubject to the requirement to follow suit, each player must play a card that beats the highest card so far played to the trick if possible.\n\nA player who is unable to beat the highest card played to the trick, is still forced to follow suit if possible, and otherwise to trump. If the trick has already been trumped, and you are unable to follow suit, you must overtrump if possible, but if your trumps are not high enough to overtrump, you must still play a trump.\nHowever, if you are unable to beat the highest card in the trick, you are under no obligation to play a high card, provided that you obey the rules of following suit or trumping. Example: spades are trumps and the queen of diamonds is led. The second player trumps with the four of spades. Playing third, you hold the ace and six of diamonds and some spades. You have diamonds so you are not allowed to trump, and therefore cannot win the trick. You can and should play your six of diamonds, not the ace. If the second player had played a diamond, you would have been obliged to play the ace of diamonds, to beat the queen.\nA player who has no card of the suit led and has no trumps either can play any card, but of course cannot win the trick.\nIf the dealer is playing, the dealer\'s card that was dealt face up to determine the trump suit counts as belonging to the dealer\'s hand (except in the very unusual case that the dealer chose to discard it) and is played in accordance with the rules of play above.\nA player who has three sure tricks irrespective of how the cards are played, and is therefore certain to win the pot, is said to have a cinch. In this case there are additional restrictions.\n\nIf you have a cinch and it is your turn to lead, you must lead your highest trump. \nIf you have a cinch and are playing on a trick to which another player led, and you are able to play a trump to the trick, you must play your highest trump.\nIf you have a cinch and are playing last to a trick, there are no special restrictions - you must simply win the trick if you can, subject to the usual restrictions of following suit and trumping.\n\nNote that your hand can be a cinch at the start of the play if you have a trump holding such as A-K-Q or K-Q-10-9-8. It can become a cinch later, for example if after winning a trick you have two sure trump tricks. Also, if you win the first three tricks, the cinch rules apply since you are sure to take the pot, and you must lead a trump to the fourth trick if you have one.\nWhen you are required to play your "highest" trump because your hand is a cinch, the play of an adjacent trump - such as the King from Ace-King or the Jack from King-Jack when the Queen has already been played - is acceptable.\nPayments\nThe player who wins most tricks takes the whole pot. To win the pot it is necessary to win more tricks than any other single player. Three tricks are always sufficient. The pot can be won with two tricks if three other players take one trick each.\nIf there is a tie for most tricks (when the tricks divide 2-2-1, and in the rare case of five players taking one trick each) no one takes the pot. This is known as a "split pot" but the pot is not shared out - it remains for the next deal and the new antes and any penalties are added to it.\nAnyone who plays and takes no trick is said to have gone "bourr". These players must pay an amount equal to the whole contents of the pot. This payment forms part of the pot for the next deal.\nA player who goes bourr does not have to place the normal one chip ante for the next deal. Also, if the pot is split, the players who tied for most tricks do not post an ante for the next deal. All remaining players pay one chip ante as usual.\nIn the following example the seven players are A, B, C, D, E, F and G.\nDeal 1: All seven players ante so there are 7 chips in the pot. B, C, E and G play; the others pass. E wins 3 tricks, B and G win one each and C is bourr. E takes the 7 chips from the pot. C must pay 7 chips to the next pot. All players must ante for the next deal except for C. Therefore the pot now contains 13 chips.\nDeal 2: With 13 chips in the pot, A, B, E and F play. The others pass. A and F take 2 tricks each, B takes one and E none. This is a spilt pot between A and F, so no one wins it. E has to add 13 chips to the pot, and B, C, D and G each ante one chip for the next deal, so the pot now contains 30 chips.\nDeal 3: Only C, D and E play, and D wins all five tricks. D takes the 30 chips from the pot and C and E must each pay 30 chips to the next pot. In addition everyone except C and E must pay an ante for the next deal, and the pot now contains 65 chips.\nIt should be clear from this example that the pot can sometimes build rather quickly, especially if more than one player is bourr or there is a split pot. For this reason the game is sometimes played with a limit. For example if the limit is 20 chips, then when the pot contains more than 20 chips, a player who wins takes only 20 chips from the pot, and a player who is bourr pays only 20 chips.\nAny play that is not in accordance with the rules of play - such as failure to follow suit, failure to trump or failure to beat the highest card in the trick when able, is known as a renege. If the renege is not corrected before the next player plays a card, the penalty is to pay an amount equal to the size of the pot, exactly as though the player had gone bourr.\nHowever, if having reneged you realise your error before the next player plays, you are allowed to recall your card and substitute a correct card. In this case you forfeit the right to win the pot, even if you take most tricks, and you forfeit your next turn to deal, but you do not have to match the pot (unless you win no tricks).\nVariations\nDouble Ante\nIn this variation, all players pay an ante of one chip before the deal, and in addition, any player who decides to play must pay an additional chip to the pot. Those who pass do not pay this second ante - they just lose their first ante and forgo their chance to win the pot in this deal.\nIn the double ante game, it is normal to require an initial ante from all players, including those who paid for a bourr or were involved in a split pot on the previous deal.\nSome play that the decisions whether or not to play and how many cards to draw are separated into two separate rounds. First each player in turn declares either "play" (paying a second ante of one chip) or "pass". After everyone has declared, there is a second round in which those who decided to play discard cards if they wish and are dealt replacements.\nSeparate Trump Card\nSome play that five cards are dealt face down to each player, and then an extra card is dealt face up to determine the trump suit. There are two forms of this variation.\n\nThe turned up trump belongs to no one. It indicates the trump suit but cannot be taken or played by any player.\nThe turned up trump can be taken by the dealer if he or she decides to play. The dealer effectively has six cards; if for example the dealer discards four cards and elects to use the turned up trump, three replacement cards will be dealt to make up the dealer\'s five-card hand.\n\nSimultaneous Declaration\nSome play that instead of declaring in rotation, all players decide independently whether they will play or pass. Those who want to play hold a chip in their closed fist; those who pass hold an empty fist. All reveal their decisions simultaneously and then those who decided to play discard in rotation as ussual.\nI suspect that this variation is not traditional in Louisiana, but was adopted by poker players, who use a similar method for declaring high or low in some hi-lo games.\nFour card Bourr\nVictoria Diemer reports that in Indiana, Bourr is played with just four cards dealt to each player, with a separate card that belongs to no one indicating the trump suit. Players must have at least one trump or at least one club (a "dirty club") to play, which costs one chip. After players have decided whether to stay, up to 3 cards can be discarded, but not all four. After the draw, players have another chance to pass; those who want to play must pay an additional chip. As usual the player who takes most chips wins the pot, and if there is a tie the pot is carried over to the next deal. Anyone who takes no tricks must match the pot for the next deal. The penalty for a renege is twice the pot.\nOther Bourr Web Sites\nAnother description of Bourr is available on Wikipedia.\nRules of a simplified version of Boo-Ray can be found in Peter Sarrett\'s Game Report site (archive copy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Trump group > Rams Group > Bourr\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2006, 2009.

A point is scored by the winner of each three-card hand, and the first to an agreed target score wins the game. Unlike Three Card Brag, on which the hand patterns are based, Crash and the other games on this page are not high stake gambling games. They are usually played for a small amount of money, and there is no process of betting to raise the stake.\nCrash\nI am grateful to the many people who have contributed information about Crash, including: Bob Allison, David Calvert, Matt Daligan, Ben Hall, David Jennings, Robert Jones, Stephen Lowry, Allister Paterson, Peter Rollinson, Tom Valentine and Stephen Williams.\nThe game of Crash is also known as Thirteen Card Brag. It is played over a large part of the north of England and in Wales - I have reports ranging from Coventry and Burton-on-Trent in the south to Cumbria and Yorkshire in the north, from Welshpool and from South Wales; also one report from Plymouth and one from Edinburgh, where the game was known as Crackers. There are numerous variations in the rules. I will try to list all those I have collected, and would be interested in comments and in further reports of places where Crash is played and the versions in use.\nPlayers, cards and deal\nCrash is essentially a four player game. It is played with a standard 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen at random. One method is to deal the cards around face up: the first player who receives a seven is the first dealer. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts, and the dealer deals out all the cards clockwise, one at a time, so that everyone has 13 cards. After the cards have been played and scored, the turn to deal passes to the left.\nIt is possible for three people to play. In this case four 13-card hands are still dealt: three to the players and one face-down spare hand. Starting with the player to dealer\'s left, each player in turn then has the option to discard their hand and take the spare hand in exchange (without first knowing what the spare hand contains). Some play that anyone exchanging for the spare hand must put an additional stake in the pool which will be taken by the eventual winner of the game.\nIf two people wish to play, there will be two spare hands, and each player may keep the hand they are dealt or exchange it sight unseen for one of the spares.\nThe Play\nEach player divides their 13 cards into up to four three-card Brag hands, which are placed face down in front of the player in descending order from left to right. The card or cards remaining are set aside.\nThe valid three-card hands in descending order are:\n\nPrial: three cards of the same rank - threes highest, then aces, kings, etc.\nRunning Flush, also known as a \'run on the bounce\' or a trotter: three consecutive cards in one suit - 3-2-A highest, then A-K-Q, down to 4-3-2 (lowest)\nRun: three consecutive cards of mixed suits - ranking as for running flushes.\nFlush: three cards of the same suit (ace high)\nPair: two cards of the same rank with any third card (aces high)\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Brag hands, these combinations are explained in more detail at the end of this page.\nNote that three unrelated cards - all different ranks, mixed suits and not consecutive - do not form a valid hand. Normally you arrange your 13 cards into four 3-card hands and discard the last card, but in some cases you be unable or unwilling to make as many as four valid hands from your 13 cards. In that case you just make as many hands as you wish - perhaps only two or three - and discard your remaining cards.\nWhen all are ready, everyone reveals their leftmost 3-card hand (highest hand), and the best of these hands scores a point. Then everyone reveals their second hand and the best of the second hands again scores a point, then the same again for the third hands and the fourth hands.\nIt can happen that there is a tie for best hand - for example two players have equally high runs with different suits. This is called a stick-up or a stopper, and no one scores the corresponding point.\nYou must always place your 3-card hands in descending order from left to right. Anyone who places a better hand to the right of a worse hand (so unfairly increasing their chance of winning one of the later points) automatically loses the game. Also, if you make fewer than four hands, the hands that you do make must always compete for the earliest points - for example the first three points if you made three hands.\nScoring\nDifferent target scores are used in different places - some play to 7 points; some to 10, 11, 13 or even 21. The target score may be increased if there are fewer than 4 players - for example 4 players play to 11 points, two or three play to 15. In South Wales, the game is played to 12 points, but the leader must be 2 points ahead of the second placed player to win; if not, play continues until someone achieves a 2-point lead.\n\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the target. This may happen before all the hands have been compared. For example, in a 7-point game, if two players have 6, and one of them wins the first (left) hand of the next deal, that player has won the game by reaching 7 first, even if the second player had the best of the second, third and fourth hands.\nIn some places the score is kept on paper. Sometimes a special peg-board is used: illustrated to the right are two designs for the 7-point game from Salford and Coventry; players start from the corners and the winner is the first to reach the centre hole. Some score on a cribbage board, each player using one of the four tracks, starting from one end, the aim of course being to reach the agreed target score first.\nThe winner of the game is paid by the other three players. Some use a fixed payment per game - such as 50p; others play that each pays the winner an amount (for example 1p or 2p) for each point that they are short of the target. In either case, some play that anyone who scored no points at all during the game must pay double. Some play that if all three opponents of the winner scored zero points, the payment for game is trebled.\nThe Crash\nA crash occurs when one player wins all four points in a deal. This is rewarded with an extra score, which should be agreed on before playing, because it varies from place to place.\n\nSome play that a crash wins the current game outright.\nIn some places a crash is worth just one extra point - five points instead of the usual four.\nSome play that a crash wins four points towards the current game, and in addition the player who crashed is paid an extra stake (usually equal to the value of a game) by each opponent.\n\nSome play that a crash is only valid if the player announces it after everyone has set their hands, but before any cards are exposed. In this version of the game, a player who wins all four hands without having said \'crash\' just scores four points towards the current game. The player attempting crash should check that everyone is ready before announcing it; no rearrangement of hands is allowed after the announcement. Again, there are various ways of scoring:\n\nSome play that an announced crash wins the current game if successful. If a player announces crash but then fails to win all four hands, the player scores nothing for that deal.\nSome award an extra payment outside the game for a successful announced crash. If you announce crash and fail to win all four hands you have to pay the other players the amount you would have won. For example in a 10-point game where the winner is paid 2p per point difference, a player announcing a crash receives 20p from each opponent in addition to the 4 points if it succeeds; if it fails, the player scores points as usual for any hands won, but has to pay 20p to each opponent for the crash.\n\nIf a player reaches the target score before all four sets of hands have been compared, the game is over, and there can be no crash, even if the same player would have won the remaining hands. Therefore, in the version where you are paid extra for a successful announced crash, you should be careful not to announce it when you need 3 or fewer points to win: you would be certain to fail, as the game would end before you had won your four hands.\nSpecial hands\nThe following special hands are usually but not always recognised. The details should be agreed before playing.\n\nFour of a kind\nIf you have all four cards of one rank and include them all in the 3-card hands you play, this is known as a bus ride or a poppy, which scores an extra point. (It does not matter whether any of your hands actually win, as long as they include all of your four equal cards.) Usually there is also an extra payment, to be agreed in advance. When playing a fixed payment per game the extra payment could be the value of a game; when the payment is 2p per point difference, a bus ride could be worth 5p or 10p or 20p from each player, according to agreement.\nIf two or more players have bus rides, only the highest scores. For this purpose only, four fours are highest, then aces, kings, queens, etc. down to fives, threes, twos.\nSome play that in order to score or be paid for a bus ride, you must knock (or "chap") when you first receive your cards, to warn the other players that you have four of a kind before they select their 3-card hands.\nIn South Wales, some play that four of a kind (or the best four of a kind if there is more than one) wins all four points for the deal, and the cards are not played. Four fours win the game outright.\n\nPairs\nA player who is dealt six pairs can show them and demand a new deal by the same dealer. This is not compulsory - if you can make some runs you might prefer to play the hand, but if you choose to declare the pairs instead of playing, this has precedence over all other actions and payments. For example a declaration of pairs has priority over a four of a kind or a crash announcement.\nSome play that only five pairs are needed to demand a redeal.\n\nThirteen card run\nA player who has one card of each rank (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K) can choose to declare this instead of playing the hand and according to prior agreement it either wins the current game outright, or entitles the holder to a payment. The payment could be equal to the stake for the game, or equal to the value of 10 points, if payments to the winner of the game are according to difference in points. If a 13 card run is declared the hand is not played, and the deal passes to the next player.\n\nFurther Variations\n\nOptional shuffle\nSome play that the dealer may choose not to shuffle; in this case the dealer must alert the other players that the cards are not shuffled. Also, the player to dealer\'s right may choose not to cut. If there is no shuffle, players who remember the previous deal may be able to estimate how the cards are distributed in the new deal.\n\nYogi or Chas\nIn this version, in case of a tie for a point, the point is awarded to a fictional player known as Yogi (in Yorkshire) or Chas (in Lincolnshire). At the end of the game, anyone whose score is equal to or below Yogi/Chas\'s score has to pay the winner double. (This replaces the rule whereby a player with no points at all must pay double). If Yogi or Chas wins the game (having more points at the end than any of the real players), then everyone pays the cost of the game into a pool, which goes to the winner of the next game.\n\nResetting to zero\nIn this variation, if a player declares six pairs or a thirteen card run from ace to king, the scores of the other three players are reduced to zero, while the score of the declaring player stays as it is. The cards are then thrown in and the next dealer deals. \nA player who holds one of these hands might choose not to declare it but to play the cards instead. This will often be sensible if the other players have no points or very few points to lose - a thirteen card run can be played as four runs, some of which may be on the bounce, so it should bring in at least one point.\n\nNo pairs\nIn some places, a pair is not a valid hand. The lowest playable three-card hand is a flush.\n\nNine Card Brag\nNine Card Brag can be played by up to five people. Everyone pays a stake to the pool and nine cards are dealt to each player. \n\nIf anyone has four of a kind, they show it and the best four of a kind wins the pot. \nIf anyone has four pairs, they can show them and "save the game". No one wins the pot, each player contributes another stake to it, and the next player deals.\nWinning the pot with four of a kind has priority over saving the game with four pairs.\n\nIf no one declares four of a kind or four pairs, each player divides their nine cards into three three-card Brag hands, placing the highest of these face down to their left, the lowest to their right and the middle hand between them. The left hands are exposed first, beginning with the player to dealer\'s left. Whoever has the best left hand begins exposing the middle hands, and whoever has the best of these begins exposing the right hands. Hands are always exposed in turn, going clockwise around the table. If there is a tie for best hand in any of the three rounds, the player who was first to expose the best hand wins that hand and is first to expose the next hand.\nThe ranking of Brag hands is as listed below, except that most play that the highest prial or is a set of nines, second is a set of aces, and other prials follow in the natural order: kings, queens, jacks, 10s, 8s, 7s, 6s, 5s, 4s, 3s, 2s. Fours of a kind rank in the same order as prials.\nA set of three cards which are not a run, flush or pair can also be played as a hand, and if all players play this, the highest card wins (if two or more people have the same highest card, the second highest card is compared, and if these are also equal, the third card).\nTo win the pot, a player must win at least two hands of the three hands. If three players win one hand each, the game is "saved" - that is, the pot is carried over to the next deal, and each player must contribute a further stake to it.\nVariations of Nine-Card Brag\nMany play that the pot is only won if a single player wins or at least ties all three hands. In this version the order in which the hands are exposed is not significant. If the same players tie as winners of all three hands, or if no player is best or equal best in all three hands, no one wins and the pot is carried forward to the next deal, everyone adding another stake.\nSome play that a prial of threes or a prial of sevens, rather than nines, is highest.\nSome play that after looking at his hand, the dealer can decide to deal a tenth card to each player. Each player must then discard one card and the play proceeds as usual. This gives the dealer a slight advantage, in that the other players have no say over whether the tenth card is dealt.\nSome play that if you consider you have no chance of winning you can call a "bum deal" and "pack" (i.e. throw in) your cards - this has no real effect on the game - the others play as usual, and you are entitled to play your cards rather than packing, however bad they are.\nSome play that four pairs have priority over four of a kind.\nSome play that a nine card running flush beats four of a kind. \nVictor Wakefield reports a version in which two jokers are added to the pack, allowing six people to play. A joker can be used to represent a specific rank or a specific suit - so it can be used to make a prial or a run or a flush, but not a running flush. Between two otherwise equal hands, one made of natural cards beats one containing a joker. When used in a flush, the joker always counts as the lowest card of its suit - so for example 7-4-joker beats 7-3-2, which in turn beats 7-3-joker.\nIn the six player game with two jokers, all the cards are dealt, but it is still possible to play the variant where the dealer can deal a tenth card as follows. If a player calls a "bum deal", then the dealer may shuffle that player\'s cards and deal one each to the remaining five players. These players each discard a card and the discards along with the undealt cards of the bum deal hand can be taken by the player who called the bum deal and played as a hand.\nSome play that jokers are exactly equivalent to the card they substitute for - wild cards are not inferior to natural ones. So 10-9-8 and 10-joker-8 are equal hands the first exposed would win. Nevertheless, in this version, jokers cannot be used to claim the pot by making four of a kind - only a natural four of a kind wins outright.\nSome play that declaring four pairs has priority over declaring four of a kind.\nNine-Card Brag is sometimes played for points, rather than with a pot for each deal. In that case the points scored in each deal are as follows:\n\n3 points for 4 of a kind, or\n1 point for saving the game (4 pair), or\n4 points for winning all three 3-card hands, or\n1 point for each 3-card hand won (if no one wins all three)\n\nA target number of points is set, and the player who first reaches or passes the target wins the pot. Alternatively a time limit can be set after which a fixed number of deals is played, for example "last 4 deals" could be called at 7.30 pm.  \n  In this game a player cannot win the pot by saving the game. If a player achieves the highest score by saving the game in the last deal, another deal must be played.\n  \n\nIn the point scoring version with a target score, some play that a player who has four of a kind can choose to peg six points or to set all the other players back six points.\nSix Card Brag\nEveryone contributes an agreed stake to the pot, and the dealer deals out 6 cards to each player, one at a time. If anyone has four cards of the same rank they declare this immediately and the best four of a kind wins.\nIf no one has four of a kind, each player divides their six cards into two three-card Brag hands, placing them face-down on the table with the higher on the left and the lower on the right. The player to dealer\'s left begins by exposing his left hand. The other players in turn either pass or expose their left hands. Whoever has the best left hand (or the first of these if there is a tie) then exposes his right hand. The other players in turn do the same or pass.\nThe ranking of Brag hands is as listed below, except that most play that the highest prial or is a set of sixes, second is a set of aces, and other prials follow in the natural order: kings, queens, jacks, 10s, 9s, 8s, 7s, 5s, 4s, 3s, 2s. Fours of a kind rank in the same order.\nA set of three cards which are not a run, flush or pair can also be played as a hand, and if all players play this, the highest card wins (if two or more people have the same highest card, the second highest card is compared, and if these are also equal, the third card).\nIf one player has the highest left hand and the highest right hand, or wins one of these and ties the other, or ties for best with both hands, that player wins the pot. If the same two players tie for best left hand and for best right hand then they split the pot equally between them. In any other case, no one wins, and the pot is carried forward to the next deal, everyone adding another stake.\nVariation: some play that a six-card running flush - for example 3-4-5-6-7-8-9 of one suit - wins the hand, beating four of a kind.\nSeven Card Brag\nThis game is the same as Six Card Brag, except for the following.\n\nSeven cards are dealt to each player.\nIf no one has four of a kind, each player discards one card face down before dividing the remaining six into a left hand and a right hand.\nThe highest prial or four of a kind is a set of sevens, others ranking in their natural order - so the order of precedence for prials and fours of a kind is 7-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-6-5-4-3-2.\nSome play that a seven card running flush beats four of a kind. \n\n\n\nRank of Brag hands\nThe order of the possible three-card Brag hands, from highest to lowest, is as follows.\n\nCombinationExamplesExplanation\nPrial3-3-3A-A-A. . .2-2-2"Prial" - short for "pair royal" - is the name in Brag for a set of three cards of equal rank. The best is usually a prial of threes, though in some variations some other prial is best (this will be specified in the rules for the relevant game). The remaining prials follow in the rank order of the cards: A-A-A, K-K-K, Q-Q-Q, etc. down to 2-2-2, three twos being the lowest prial.\nRunning flushorRun on the bounce3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2A running flush is a set of three consecutive cards of the same suit. A run is a set of three consecutive cards of mixed suits. Although the ace is high, A-2-3 counts as a valid run - or a valid running flush if all the cards are the same suit. In fact A-2-3 is the highest run or running flush, A-K-Q of a suit is the second highest, then K-Q-J, and so on down to 4-3-2, which is the lowest. 2-A-K is not a valid run or running flush.\nAny running flush beats any run with mixed suits - so for example 4-3-2 beats 3-2-A or A-K-Q. \nRun3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2\nFlushA-K-J. . .5-3-2A flush consists of three cards of the same suit - not all consecutive, or it would be a running flush. When comparing flushes, the highest card is compared first, then if these are equal the middle card, and finally if necessary the lowest. Therefore K-9-2 beats Q-10-5, which beats Q-10-3, which beats Q-9-8.\nPairA-A-K. . .2-2-3A pair consists of two cards of equal rank. The third card is of a different rank, otherwise you would have a prial. When comparing pairs, the rank of the pair is compared first, and if these are equal the odd card determines which is higher. So for example 9-9-3 beats 8-8-K, which beats 8-8-J.\n\nThe above are the only 3-card hands that are playable in Crash. In Three Card Brag, it is also possible to play three unmatched cards - cards that are not consecutive, not all of the same suit and contain no pair. These rank according to their highest card; if the highest cards of two hands are equal the second highest cards are compared, and if these are equal too then the third highest. So J-6-3 beats 10-9-7, which beats 10-9-6. An example of the highest unmatched set is A-K-J and of the lowest is 5-3-2. These unmatched sets can be used in 6-card, 7-card and 9-card Brag, but not in Crash.\nThere is no order of suits in Brag, so it is possible for two hands to be equal in rank - for example 7-7-Q is equal to 7-7-Q.\nPoker players should take care to note that a running flush (\'straight flush\') is beaten by a prial in this game, and that the \'run\' and \'flush\' in Brag rank in the opposite order to Poker.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Showdown games > Partition Games > Crash (13-card Brag)\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2000, 2001, 2003.

It is sometimes said to be similar to poker, but in fact it is much older and the method of betting is different. The basic game of three-card Brag was one of the games described by Hoyle, and therefore dates from the late eighteenth century or earlier. It is almost identical to the popular Indian game Teen Pathi ("three cards").\nOn this page, Three Card Brag and its Four-card and Five-card variations will be described. There are other games known as 6-card, 7-card, 9-card and 13-card Brag; but they have a very different mechanism and will are covered on a separate page.\nThis page has been put together from a variety of sources, and I am grateful to those who have contributed, including: Jon Garibaldi, Thomas Olsson, Dave Phillips, Jamie Prestidge, Chris Roberts, Phill Rogers, Brian Rollo, Justin Thurkettle, Mike Tobias.\nThree Card Brag\nPlayers, cards and preparation\nA standard 52 card pack without jokers is used. The cards in each suit rank in the usual order from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. The number of players can vary, but it is probably best for about 4 to 8 people.\nThree Card Brag is a gambling game. Before starting it is essential that the players agree on the stake and have a common understanding of the rules. It is necessary to agree:\n\n\nthe initial stake or ante - which is the amount (if any) that everyone must put into the pot before each deal;\nthe minimum and maximum initial bet - the amount that the first player bets in order to stay in the hand;\nthe limit (if any) on the amount by which the bet can be increased by each subsequent player;\nany variations to the basic rules, such as use of wild cards.\n\n\nRanking of hands\nThe order of the possible three-card Brag hands, from highest to lowest, is as follows.\n\nCombinationExamplesExplanation\nPrial3-3-3A-A-A. . .2-2-2"Prial" - short for "pair royal" - is the name in Brag for a set of three cards of equal rank. The best is threes, and the other prials follow in the rank order of the cards: A-A-A, K-K-K, Q-Q-Q, etc. down to 5-5-5, 4-4-4, 2-2-2, three twos being the lowest prial.\nRunning flush3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2A running flush is a set of three consecutive cards of the same suit. A run is a set of three consecutive cards of mixed suits. Although the ace is high, A-2-3 counts as a valid run - or a valid running flush if all the cards are the same suit. In fact A-2-3 is the highest run or running flush, A-K-Q of a suit is the second highest, then K-Q-J, and so on down to 4-3-2, which is the lowest. 2-A-K is not a valid run or running flush.\nAny running flush beats any run with mixed suits - so for example 4-3-2 beats 3-2-A or A-K-Q. \nRun3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2\nFlushA-K-J. . .5-3-2A flush consists of three cards of the same suit - not all consecutive, or it would be a running flush. When comparing flushes, the highest card is compared first, then if these are equal the middle card, and finally if necessary the lowest. Therefore K-9-2 beats Q-10-5, which beats Q-10-3, which beats Q-9-8.\nPairA-A-K. . .2-2-3A pair consists of two cards of equal rank. The third card is of a different rank, otherwise you would have a prial. When comparing pairs, the rank of the pair is compared first (aces are highest), and if two players have the same pair the odd card determines which and is higher. So for example 9-9-3 beats 8-8-K, which beats 8-8-J.\nHigh cardA-K-J. . .5-3-2Three cards that do not form any of the above combinations. As with flushes, these rank according to the highest card; if the highest cards of two hands are equal the second highest cards are compared, and if these are equal too then the third highest. So J-6-3 beats 10-9-7, which beats 10-9-6.\n\nThere is no order of suits, so it is possible for two hands to be equal in rank - for example 7-7-Q is equal to 7-7-Q. In a contest between two equal hands the calling player (the player who paid to see the other hand) loses (see betting, below).\nPoker players should take care to note that the \'run\' and \'flush\' in Brag rank in the opposite order to Poker.\nAnte and deal\nBefore each deal, each player must place the agreed initial stake (ante) in the pot. Deal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nIf it is the first deal of the session, the dealer shuffles. For subsequent deals, the cards are only shuffled if the previous hand was "seen" and won by a prial. Apart from that, the cards not normally shuffled between hands. The cards from the previous hand are just added to the bottom of the pack and the dealer deals the new hands from the top, without shuffling.\nThe dealer deals out the cards one at a time, face down to the players, until everyone has three cards. Players may look at their own cards, or may choose not to, if they wish to play "blind" - see below. Cards must at never be shown to any player other than the person to whom they were dealt, unless the betting ends with a "see". In that case the cards of the two players involved (but none of the others) are exposed for everyone to see.\nNote: the practice of not shuffling makes it possible in some circumstances to know what cards are in play when the same cards come around again.\nThe betting\nWhen the cards have been dealt, the betting begins with the player to the left of the dealer. This person can \'fold\' (throw in their cards and take no further part in the hand) or can bet any amount from the agreed minimum to the agreed maximum. If all the players except one fold, the last remaining player takes all the money in the pot, and the next hand is dealt.\nIf any player bets, every player after that must either fold or bet at least as much as the previous player who bet. A player may bet more than the previous player, but there may be an agreed limit to the amount by which the bet can be increased. The betting continues around the table as many times as necessary.\nWhen there are only two players left in the game, all the others having folded, a third option becomes available. Either player can see the other. Seeing costs twice as much as the previous player\'s bet. When you pay to see another player, they expose their three cards first. If your cards are better than your opponent\'s, you expose your hand to prove this and win the pot. If your cards are equal to your opponent\'s or worse, your opponent wins the pot - you do not have to show your cards in this case. Note that if the hands are equal, the player who paid to see loses.\nPoker players should notice that there is no concept of equalising the bets. At each turn, to stay in you have to put into the pot at least as much new money as the previous player put in. Here are some examples from a four player game:\n\nPlayer A bets 2 chips, B folds, C bets 2 chips and D bets 2 chips. In order to stay in, A would have to bet another 2 chips.\nPlayer A bets 2 chips, B folds, C bets 4 chips and D folds. Player A can now see player C by paying 8 chips (twice C\'s bet) or pay at least 4 chips to stay in, or fold, allowing C to win the pot. If A pays 4 to stay in, C now has the same options: put 8 in the pot to see A, to bet at least 4 and allow A another turn to bet, or to fold and allow A to win.\n\nBetting continues until either \n\nall players but one have dropped out (folded) (in which case the remaining player obviously wins, but does not show their cards), or \ntwo players are left and one player pays double to see the other.\n\nAs each player folds, that player\'s cards are added to the bottom of the pack ready for the next deal. At the end of the betting the cards of the last player left in, or the cards of the two players involved in the see, are added to the pack in the same way.\nPlease note the following basic rules of etiquette:\n\nDo not show your cards - to anybody\nDo not say anything about your hand\nNever (ever) fold out of turn\n\nBreaking any of the above three rules will get you thrown out of any Brag game.\nHere is an example of betting between five players:\n\nRoundAndyBillChrisDanEddie\n1\t111fold2\n2222-2\n3222-2\n42fold2-5\n55-5-5\n65-5-5\n75-fold-10\n810---10\n910---10\n1020 (to see)\n\nPoints to note\n\nAndy bets 1 (one) first round, Bill and Chris match 1, Eddie raises to 2. Andy (A) now must bet 2 to stay in, regardless of the fact that he has already put 1 (one) in. Similar for B and C.\nThe betting can remain at 2 (e.g. rounds 1-4) indefinitely. If everyone is staying in, eventually someone (e.g. E) must force the pace.\nIn rounds 5 and 6 A, C and E are all in. No-one can see, and all must remain. In situations like this, it is simply a matter of nerve. Someone must fold for the betting to end - and eventually C does.\n\nWhen there are only two remaining (A and E, rounds 8-10), then either can decide to pay double to \'see\'. When A bets 20 to \'see\' on round 10, \the must say \'See you\' (or equivalent). It is perfectly acceptable to double the betting without \'seeing\', in which case the game continues as normal.\n\nA common (but not necessary) house limit on raising is to agree that no-one can raise the pot by more than its current contents. So, for a five player game, the maximum initial stake would be 5 times the ante.\nRunning out of money\nBrag is seldom played with what Poker players know as table stakes (where players keep the money they are playing with on the table for everyone to see and cannot introduce extra money into the game except between hands and with the agreement of all the players). Brag players often keep their money in their pockets until needed. It is usual to insist that each player wishing to take part in a game should placed at least a certain minimum amount of money on the table - say 10. After that, players are free to introduce more money to the game at any time.\nSome play that if you do not have enough money left to bet, but want to stay in, you place all your remaining money in the pot, and put your cards face down on top of it. This is called covering the pot. If there are two or more other players, they continue betting as before, but putting the money into a new pot. After this new pot is settled, the winner\'s hand is exposed, and the hand of the player who ran out of money is compared with it. The old pot is won by the higher hand, or by the winner of the new pot in case of a tie.\nThe method of covering the pot can also be used when there are only two players left in the game. If one of the players runs out of money, the betting ends when one player puts the last of his money in the pot - the other player does not have to put in any more money but exposes his cards, and wins the pot unless the player who ran out of money can show a better hand.\nAlthough covering the pot might seem to work unfairly in favour of the player who runs out of money, thus getting to see the opponent\'s hand cheaply, it does avoid some undesirable situations.\nHowever, according to the information I have received from Brag players, it is quite usual to play the harsher rule that a player who does not have enough money to bet the full amount required must either fold or borrow money from another player or a bystander to make up the bet. For this purpose, the player is allowed to show his cards to a player who has already dropped out, who might be prepared to back him financially. Sometimes there is an agreement that whoever in the game has most money will lend some to the player who is short to allow that player to continue to bet.\nSome people play that when only two players are in the game, and one of them runs out of money, the player who still has money has the choice of either\n\nlending some money to the other player to allow betting to continue, or\nshowing his cards, in which case he wins the pot unless the other player can show a better hand.\n\nIt is clear that betting with borrowing could potentially lead to some difficult situations, in which a player must either fold a good hand or borrow money he may not be in a position to repay. When blind betting is allowed, there is even more scope for this kind of problem, since a blind player can carry on betting indefinitely against an open player, and the open player cannot see the blind player.\nSometimes, in a situation where three (or more) players are betting against each other and none of them is prepared to fold, if they all feel that the pot is getting too big, they may agree to a showdown in which all cards are exposed and the highest hand wins.\nI would like to hear from any experienced Brag players who can let me know more about the correct way to handle these situations.\nPlaying blind\nExperienced players usually allow the extra option of playing blind. Any player may choose to play any hand blind. If you are playing blind you do not look at your cards, but leave them face down on the table. You take part in the betting in the normal way, except that all your bets are worth double. In other words, at each stage you only have to put in half the amount of money you would need to bet if you had looked at your cards.\nIf you have been playing blind, then at your turn to bet, you can choose to look at your cards before deciding whether to bet or fold. From that moment on you are no longer a blind player, and if you then want to stay in, you must revert to the same betting amount as the \'non-blind\' players.\nIf you are playing blind and all the other players fold - which would be surprising but I am assured that it does happen - you do not win the pot. Instead, the pot is carried forward to the next deal and you are allowed to retain your hand - see below.\nWhen just two players remain, one or both of whom are playing blind, the possibilities for one player to "see" the other - i.e. pay for the hands to be exposed and compared - are as follows.\n\nYou are playing open and your opponent is blind. The rule is that "you cannot see a blind man". Therefore your only options are to continue betting or to fold. \nBoth players are blind. By putting in twice the blind stake (i.e. the amount that would be paid by an open player) you can cause the hands to be compared. Usually the players turn their cards face up one at a time, alternately, beginning with the opponent of the player who paid for the show. In case of equality, as usual, the player who paid for the show loses.\nYou are playing blind but your opponent is playing open. Your opponent cannot see you (by the above rule), but you can see your opponent if you wish by putting in twice the blind stake (i.e. the same amount that your open opponent just bet). As usual in a showdown, the opponent\'s cards are exposed first and then you show your cards if they are better.\nA betting example:\n\nRoundAndyBillChrisDanEddie\n111 (blind)21 (blind)\t2\n221 (blind)21 (blind)\t2\n321 (blind)21 (blind)2\n421 (blind)42 (blind)fold\n545 (blind)10fold-\n6fold5 (blind)10--\n7-5 (blind)10--\n8-10 (to see)\n\nPoints to note:\n\nB must pay double the blind stake to \'see\' C\'s hand. C is not allowed to see B in round 6 or 7, even though only two players are left.\n\nNote how after 4 rounds B has only spent 4 chips compared to C who has spent 10. This type of inequity often happens when playing with blind hands, and is part of the whole essence of the procedure.\nLooking at a \'blind\' hand out of turn is another Brag \'faux-pas\' which will get other Brag players (very) annoyed. The reason is that (for example) during round 4, when C raises to 4, if B now looks at his cards it has immediately changed the basis of A\'s decision as to whether to stay in or fold on his turn. He would then have only one \'blind\' opponent (as D stays \'blind\'), instead of potentially two \'blind\' opponents (D and possibly B).\n\nRetaining a blind hand\nIf you end up with a blind hand when all other players have dropped out, you may retain the blind hand on the table. The next hand is then dealt, so that you now have two sets of cards in front of you. You may either:\n\nlook at the new hand\nlook at the old hand\nlook at neither\n\nIf you look at one of the hands, you must immediately decide whether to keep it or fold it. If you keep it, you must fold the other (without looking at it). You are then non-blind and play the looked-at hand normally. If you decide to fold the hand you looked at, then you have just one blind hand to play by the usual rules; you can look at it now or later if you wish.\nIf you look at neither hand, you can play both hands \'blind\' until (at some point) you choose to look at one of them, in which case you follow the same procedure above.\nIn the unlikely event that you win the pot again, without having looked at either \'blind\' hand,\nyou may choose to retain either (but only one), sight unseen, before the next deal. You cannot have three \'blind\' hands at once.\nNote that at no stage when playing two hands \'blind\' can you look at both and choose the better one - you must look at just one and choose to keep it or fold it, before looking at the other.\nVariation\nSome groups treat retained blind hands differently. The player who won blind is dealt a second hand face up, while everyone else is dealt a hand face down as usual. The other players must look at their hands and anyone who cannot beat the face up hand must fold. If all have folded, the player with the retained blind hand collects the antes, keeps the blind hand, and the next player deals. If a player or players stay in, then the face up hand is discarded and the the retained blind hand plays against the others in the usual way, with the normal betting rules and procedure for looking at the blind hand. If the player with the blind hand wins again by everyone folding, he will again be dealt a face up hand alongside the retained blind hand. This continues until the blind player has looked at his blind hand, after which the play reverts to normal.\nThe odds\nJon Garibaldi has provided the following analysis.\nAs there are so few total different hands, it is not difficult to calculate the prior probabilities.\nThere are a total of 22,100 different card combinations (52*51*50/3!). The number of ways to make each hand, and approx odds, are as follows:\n\nHandCombinationsProbabilityOdds\nPrial Threes41/55255524 to 1\nOther Prial481/460459 to 1\nRunning Flush48\t1/460459 to 1\nRun7201/3130 to 1\nFlush10961/2019 to 1\nPair37441/65 to 1\nHigh Card164403/43 to 1 on\n(total combinations)22100\n\nObviously, these odds are affected by previous cards, if the deck isn\'t shuffled.\nAdvice on play\nJohn Garibaldi has contributed the following advice.\n\nStudy the odds carefully and remember them.\nPlay by the odds.\nDon\'t stick rigidly to playing by the odds!! You will lose very quickly, and never win a big pot if you never bluff.\nPlaying \'blind\' well is very difficult and takes years of practice. If you play it too often, and non-expertly you will lose.\nDon\'t bet too big, especially if you are used to Poker betting. As the Brag betting can continue indefinitely, on the same amount (and indeed must, until there are only two players) the pot can get very large even when each single bet seems low.\n\nFour Card Brag\nThis is the same game as Three Card Brag, except that four cards are dealt to each player. Players who look at their hands discard one card before the betting begins to form the best three card hand they can make. In case of a tie between two hands, the discarded card is used to decide which is better. If the discarded cards were also equal in rank then the player who was seen wins the tie.\nIf betting blind is allowed, a blind player will keep all four cards face down on the table. If you have been playing blind and decide to look at your cards, you discard one after looking at them.\nFive Card Brag\nThis is similar to Four Card Brag, but five cards are dealt to each player, and everyone discards two cards to make their best three card brag hand.\nWild Cards\nBrag is sometimes played with wild cards, also known as floaters. The cards that are considered wild (if any) vary from group to group, so if you wish to play with wild cards it is important to agree the details before playing. Some possibilities are:\n\nAll twos wild;\nOnly the black twos wild;\nOne eyed jacks wild - namely the J and J which are drawn in profile with one eye visible on standard British playing-cards.\n\nSuicide king wild - this is the K whose sword is held in a position where it appears to pass through his head;\nA joker or jokers can be added to the pack to serve as wild cards.\n\nA wild card can be used to represent any card in the pack, but if two hands are otherwise equal, a hand without wild cards will beat a hand containing one or more wild cards, and a hand with fewer wild cards will beat a hand with more of them. For example, if W denotes a wild card, W-8-7 (with W representing the 9) beats 8-7-6, which beats 8-W-6. Also K-K-W beats K-W-W, which beats Q-Q-Q.\nIt seems that wild cards are often used in four-card and five-card brag, but that three card brag is more often played without them.\nVariations\nSome play that when there are just two players betting, you only need to equal the most recent bet to see the other player\'s cards (provided that he is not betting blind). Seeing does not cost a double bet.\nSome play that after the deal, the remainder of the pack is placed face up on the table, so that just one card (which was the bottom card during the deal) can be seen. Folded hands are then placed face up on top of the pack, again with just one card showing.\nPhill Rogers reports a version where when the deal has passed a full circle (i.e. one more deal than the number of players) then the next dealer gets to choose the game.  A change in variation (what cards are wild; whether blind betting is allowed; whether three four or five cards are dealt) can be dictated by the dealer; changing to a different card game, such as from Brag to Indian Poker, would have to be agreed by majority of players.\nMany books, especially in the late nineteenth and throughout the twentieth century, describe an entirely fictitious form of Brag with poker-like betting and three wild cards or "braggers"(A, J and 9). There is no evidence that Brag has ever been played that way, and it seems that this version derives from a misreading of some of the early printed descriptions. This is discussed further in Jeffrey Burton in The Playing-Card Vol XXIV No 3 (Nov-Dec 1995) and 4 (Jan-Feb 1996).\nOther sites, software and online games\nThere are several Indian sites offering online real money games of the almost identical Indian game Teen Patti (3 cards).\nDraw Brag with Poker Betting\nTo reduce the possibility of collusion in an online game, GameAccount has introduced a variation which they call "3 Card Brag Poker", which has poker-like betting and a draw. Before the deal the two players to the left of the dealer place compulsory bets, called the small and big "blinds". After the deal there is a poker-like betting round with fixed bets and raises equal to twice the big blind and a limit of three raises if there are more than two players in the pot. Then each player can discard from zero to three cards and is dealt replacement cards, after which there is a second betting round in which the bets and raises are twice as big, but again limited to three raises so long as there are more than two active players. Players do not have to look at the cards they are dealt, and so long as the play without seeing their cards they may call for half price.

It is sometimes said to be similar to poker, but in fact it is much older and the method of betting is different. The basic game of three-card Brag was one of the games described by Hoyle, and therefore dates from the late eighteenth century or earlier. It is almost identical to the popular Indian game Teen Pathi ("three cards").\nOn this page, Three Card Brag and its Four-card and Five-card variations will be described. There are other games known as 6-card, 7-card, 9-card and 13-card Brag; but they have a very different mechanism and will are covered on a separate page.\nThis page has been put together from a variety of sources, and I am grateful to those who have contributed, including: Jon Garibaldi, Thomas Olsson, Dave Phillips, Jamie Prestidge, Chris Roberts, Phill Rogers, Brian Rollo, Justin Thurkettle, Mike Tobias.\nThree Card Brag\nPlayers, cards and preparation\nA standard 52 card pack without jokers is used. The cards in each suit rank in the usual order from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. The number of players can vary, but it is probably best for about 4 to 8 people.\nThree Card Brag is a gambling game. Before starting it is essential that the players agree on the stake and have a common understanding of the rules. It is necessary to agree:\n\n\nthe initial stake or ante - which is the amount (if any) that everyone must put into the pot before each deal;\nthe minimum and maximum initial bet - the amount that the first player bets in order to stay in the hand;\nthe limit (if any) on the amount by which the bet can be increased by each subsequent player;\nany variations to the basic rules, such as use of wild cards.\n\n\nRanking of hands\nThe order of the possible three-card Brag hands, from highest to lowest, is as follows.\n\nCombinationExamplesExplanation\nPrial3-3-3A-A-A. . .2-2-2"Prial" - short for "pair royal" - is the name in Brag for a set of three cards of equal rank. The best is threes, and the other prials follow in the rank order of the cards: A-A-A, K-K-K, Q-Q-Q, etc. down to 5-5-5, 4-4-4, 2-2-2, three twos being the lowest prial.\nRunning flush3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2A running flush is a set of three consecutive cards of the same suit. A run is a set of three consecutive cards of mixed suits. Although the ace is high, A-2-3 counts as a valid run - or a valid running flush if all the cards are the same suit. In fact A-2-3 is the highest run or running flush, A-K-Q of a suit is the second highest, then K-Q-J, and so on down to 4-3-2, which is the lowest. 2-A-K is not a valid run or running flush.\nAny running flush beats any run with mixed suits - so for example 4-3-2 beats 3-2-A or A-K-Q. \nRun3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2\nFlushA-K-J. . .5-3-2A flush consists of three cards of the same suit - not all consecutive, or it would be a running flush. When comparing flushes, the highest card is compared first, then if these are equal the middle card, and finally if necessary the lowest. Therefore K-9-2 beats Q-10-5, which beats Q-10-3, which beats Q-9-8.\nPairA-A-K. . .2-2-3A pair consists of two cards of equal rank. The third card is of a different rank, otherwise you would have a prial. When comparing pairs, the rank of the pair is compared first (aces are highest), and if two players have the same pair the odd card determines which and is higher. So for example 9-9-3 beats 8-8-K, which beats 8-8-J.\nHigh cardA-K-J. . .5-3-2Three cards that do not form any of the above combinations. As with flushes, these rank according to the highest card; if the highest cards of two hands are equal the second highest cards are compared, and if these are equal too then the third highest. So J-6-3 beats 10-9-7, which beats 10-9-6.\n\nThere is no order of suits, so it is possible for two hands to be equal in rank - for example 7-7-Q is equal to 7-7-Q. In a contest between two equal hands the calling player (the player who paid to see the other hand) loses (see betting, below).\nPoker players should take care to note that the \'run\' and \'flush\' in Brag rank in the opposite order to Poker.\nAnte and deal\nBefore each deal, each player must place the agreed initial stake (ante) in the pot. Deal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nIf it is the first deal of the session, the dealer shuffles. For subsequent deals, the cards are only shuffled if the previous hand was "seen" and won by a prial. Apart from that, the cards not normally shuffled between hands. The cards from the previous hand are just added to the bottom of the pack and the dealer deals the new hands from the top, without shuffling.\nThe dealer deals out the cards one at a time, face down to the players, until everyone has three cards. Players may look at their own cards, or may choose not to, if they wish to play "blind" - see below. Cards must at never be shown to any player other than the person to whom they were dealt, unless the betting ends with a "see". In that case the cards of the two players involved (but none of the others) are exposed for everyone to see.\nNote: the practice of not shuffling makes it possible in some circumstances to know what cards are in play when the same cards come around again.\nThe betting\nWhen the cards have been dealt, the betting begins with the player to the left of the dealer. This person can \'fold\' (throw in their cards and take no further part in the hand) or can bet any amount from the agreed minimum to the agreed maximum. If all the players except one fold, the last remaining player takes all the money in the pot, and the next hand is dealt.\nIf any player bets, every player after that must either fold or bet at least as much as the previous player who bet. A player may bet more than the previous player, but there may be an agreed limit to the amount by which the bet can be increased. The betting continues around the table as many times as necessary.\nWhen there are only two players left in the game, all the others having folded, a third option becomes available. Either player can see the other. Seeing costs twice as much as the previous player\'s bet. When you pay to see another player, they expose their three cards first. If your cards are better than your opponent\'s, you expose your hand to prove this and win the pot. If your cards are equal to your opponent\'s or worse, your opponent wins the pot - you do not have to show your cards in this case. Note that if the hands are equal, the player who paid to see loses.\nPoker players should notice that there is no concept of equalising the bets. At each turn, to stay in you have to put into the pot at least as much new money as the previous player put in. Here are some examples from a four player game:\n\nPlayer A bets 2 chips, B folds, C bets 2 chips and D bets 2 chips. In order to stay in, A would have to bet another 2 chips.\nPlayer A bets 2 chips, B folds, C bets 4 chips and D folds. Player A can now see player C by paying 8 chips (twice C\'s bet) or pay at least 4 chips to stay in, or fold, allowing C to win the pot. If A pays 4 to stay in, C now has the same options: put 8 in the pot to see A, to bet at least 4 and allow A another turn to bet, or to fold and allow A to win.\n\nBetting continues until either \n\nall players but one have dropped out (folded) (in which case the remaining player obviously wins, but does not show their cards), or \ntwo players are left and one player pays double to see the other.\n\nAs each player folds, that player\'s cards are added to the bottom of the pack ready for the next deal. At the end of the betting the cards of the last player left in, or the cards of the two players involved in the see, are added to the pack in the same way.\nPlease note the following basic rules of etiquette:\n\nDo not show your cards - to anybody\nDo not say anything about your hand\nNever (ever) fold out of turn\n\nBreaking any of the above three rules will get you thrown out of any Brag game.\nHere is an example of betting between five players:\n\nRoundAndyBillChrisDanEddie\n1\t111fold2\n2222-2\n3222-2\n42fold2-5\n55-5-5\n65-5-5\n75-fold-10\n810---10\n910---10\n1020 (to see)\n\nPoints to note\n\nAndy bets 1 (one) first round, Bill and Chris match 1, Eddie raises to 2. Andy (A) now must bet 2 to stay in, regardless of the fact that he has already put 1 (one) in. Similar for B and C.\nThe betting can remain at 2 (e.g. rounds 1-4) indefinitely. If everyone is staying in, eventually someone (e.g. E) must force the pace.\nIn rounds 5 and 6 A, C and E are all in. No-one can see, and all must remain. In situations like this, it is simply a matter of nerve. Someone must fold for the betting to end - and eventually C does.\n\nWhen there are only two remaining (A and E, rounds 8-10), then either can decide to pay double to \'see\'. When A bets 20 to \'see\' on round 10, \the must say \'See you\' (or equivalent). It is perfectly acceptable to double the betting without \'seeing\', in which case the game continues as normal.\n\nA common (but not necessary) house limit on raising is to agree that no-one can raise the pot by more than its current contents. So, for a five player game, the maximum initial stake would be 5 times the ante.\nRunning out of money\nBrag is seldom played with what Poker players know as table stakes (where players keep the money they are playing with on the table for everyone to see and cannot introduce extra money into the game except between hands and with the agreement of all the players). Brag players often keep their money in their pockets until needed. It is usual to insist that each player wishing to take part in a game should placed at least a certain minimum amount of money on the table - say 10. After that, players are free to introduce more money to the game at any time.\nSome play that if you do not have enough money left to bet, but want to stay in, you place all your remaining money in the pot, and put your cards face down on top of it. This is called covering the pot. If there are two or more other players, they continue betting as before, but putting the money into a new pot. After this new pot is settled, the winner\'s hand is exposed, and the hand of the player who ran out of money is compared with it. The old pot is won by the higher hand, or by the winner of the new pot in case of a tie.\nThe method of covering the pot can also be used when there are only two players left in the game. If one of the players runs out of money, the betting ends when one player puts the last of his money in the pot - the other player does not have to put in any more money but exposes his cards, and wins the pot unless the player who ran out of money can show a better hand.\nAlthough covering the pot might seem to work unfairly in favour of the player who runs out of money, thus getting to see the opponent\'s hand cheaply, it does avoid some undesirable situations.\nHowever, according to the information I have received from Brag players, it is quite usual to play the harsher rule that a player who does not have enough money to bet the full amount required must either fold or borrow money from another player or a bystander to make up the bet. For this purpose, the player is allowed to show his cards to a player who has already dropped out, who might be prepared to back him financially. Sometimes there is an agreement that whoever in the game has most money will lend some to the player who is short to allow that player to continue to bet.\nSome people play that when only two players are in the game, and one of them runs out of money, the player who still has money has the choice of either\n\nlending some money to the other player to allow betting to continue, or\nshowing his cards, in which case he wins the pot unless the other player can show a better hand.\n\nIt is clear that betting with borrowing could potentially lead to some difficult situations, in which a player must either fold a good hand or borrow money he may not be in a position to repay. When blind betting is allowed, there is even more scope for this kind of problem, since a blind player can carry on betting indefinitely against an open player, and the open player cannot see the blind player.\nSometimes, in a situation where three (or more) players are betting against each other and none of them is prepared to fold, if they all feel that the pot is getting too big, they may agree to a showdown in which all cards are exposed and the highest hand wins.\nI would like to hear from any experienced Brag players who can let me know more about the correct way to handle these situations.\nPlaying blind\nExperienced players usually allow the extra option of playing blind. Any player may choose to play any hand blind. If you are playing blind you do not look at your cards, but leave them face down on the table. You take part in the betting in the normal way, except that all your bets are worth double. In other words, at each stage you only have to put in half the amount of money you would need to bet if you had looked at your cards.\nIf you have been playing blind, then at your turn to bet, you can choose to look at your cards before deciding whether to bet or fold. From that moment on you are no longer a blind player, and if you then want to stay in, you must revert to the same betting amount as the \'non-blind\' players.\nIf you are playing blind and all the other players fold - which would be surprising but I am assured that it does happen - you do not win the pot. Instead, the pot is carried forward to the next deal and you are allowed to retain your hand - see below.\nWhen just two players remain, one or both of whom are playing blind, the possibilities for one player to "see" the other - i.e. pay for the hands to be exposed and compared - are as follows.\n\nYou are playing open and your opponent is blind. The rule is that "you cannot see a blind man". Therefore your only options are to continue betting or to fold. \nBoth players are blind. By putting in twice the blind stake (i.e. the amount that would be paid by an open player) you can cause the hands to be compared. Usually the players turn their cards face up one at a time, alternately, beginning with the opponent of the player who paid for the show. In case of equality, as usual, the player who paid for the show loses.\nYou are playing blind but your opponent is playing open. Your opponent cannot see you (by the above rule), but you can see your opponent if you wish by putting in twice the blind stake (i.e. the same amount that your open opponent just bet). As usual in a showdown, the opponent\'s cards are exposed first and then you show your cards if they are better.\nA betting example:\n\nRoundAndyBillChrisDanEddie\n111 (blind)21 (blind)\t2\n221 (blind)21 (blind)\t2\n321 (blind)21 (blind)2\n421 (blind)42 (blind)fold\n545 (blind)10fold-\n6fold5 (blind)10--\n7-5 (blind)10--\n8-10 (to see)\n\nPoints to note:\n\nB must pay double the blind stake to \'see\' C\'s hand. C is not allowed to see B in round 6 or 7, even though only two players are left.\n\nNote how after 4 rounds B has only spent 4 chips compared to C who has spent 10. This type of inequity often happens when playing with blind hands, and is part of the whole essence of the procedure.\nLooking at a \'blind\' hand out of turn is another Brag \'faux-pas\' which will get other Brag players (very) annoyed. The reason is that (for example) during round 4, when C raises to 4, if B now looks at his cards it has immediately changed the basis of A\'s decision as to whether to stay in or fold on his turn. He would then have only one \'blind\' opponent (as D stays \'blind\'), instead of potentially two \'blind\' opponents (D and possibly B).\n\nRetaining a blind hand\nIf you end up with a blind hand when all other players have dropped out, you may retain the blind hand on the table. The next hand is then dealt, so that you now have two sets of cards in front of you. You may either:\n\nlook at the new hand\nlook at the old hand\nlook at neither\n\nIf you look at one of the hands, you must immediately decide whether to keep it or fold it. If you keep it, you must fold the other (without looking at it). You are then non-blind and play the looked-at hand normally. If you decide to fold the hand you looked at, then you have just one blind hand to play by the usual rules; you can look at it now or later if you wish.\nIf you look at neither hand, you can play both hands \'blind\' until (at some point) you choose to look at one of them, in which case you follow the same procedure above.\nIn the unlikely event that you win the pot again, without having looked at either \'blind\' hand,\nyou may choose to retain either (but only one), sight unseen, before the next deal. You cannot have three \'blind\' hands at once.\nNote that at no stage when playing two hands \'blind\' can you look at both and choose the better one - you must look at just one and choose to keep it or fold it, before looking at the other.\nVariation\nSome groups treat retained blind hands differently. The player who won blind is dealt a second hand face up, while everyone else is dealt a hand face down as usual. The other players must look at their hands and anyone who cannot beat the face up hand must fold. If all have folded, the player with the retained blind hand collects the antes, keeps the blind hand, and the next player deals. If a player or players stay in, then the face up hand is discarded and the the retained blind hand plays against the others in the usual way, with the normal betting rules and procedure for looking at the blind hand. If the player with the blind hand wins again by everyone folding, he will again be dealt a face up hand alongside the retained blind hand. This continues until the blind player has looked at his blind hand, after which the play reverts to normal.\nThe odds\nJon Garibaldi has provided the following analysis.\nAs there are so few total different hands, it is not difficult to calculate the prior probabilities.\nThere are a total of 22,100 different card combinations (52*51*50/3!). The number of ways to make each hand, and approx odds, are as follows:\n\nHandCombinationsProbabilityOdds\nPrial Threes41/55255524 to 1\nOther Prial481/460459 to 1\nRunning Flush48\t1/460459 to 1\nRun7201/3130 to 1\nFlush10961/2019 to 1\nPair37441/65 to 1\nHigh Card164403/43 to 1 on\n(total combinations)22100\n\nObviously, these odds are affected by previous cards, if the deck isn\'t shuffled.\nAdvice on play\nJohn Garibaldi has contributed the following advice.\n\nStudy the odds carefully and remember them.\nPlay by the odds.\nDon\'t stick rigidly to playing by the odds!! You will lose very quickly, and never win a big pot if you never bluff.\nPlaying \'blind\' well is very difficult and takes years of practice. If you play it too often, and non-expertly you will lose.\nDon\'t bet too big, especially if you are used to Poker betting. As the Brag betting can continue indefinitely, on the same amount (and indeed must, until there are only two players) the pot can get very large even when each single bet seems low.\n\nFour Card Brag\nThis is the same game as Three Card Brag, except that four cards are dealt to each player. Players who look at their hands discard one card before the betting begins to form the best three card hand they can make. In case of a tie between two hands, the discarded card is used to decide which is better. If the discarded cards were also equal in rank then the player who was seen wins the tie.\nIf betting blind is allowed, a blind player will keep all four cards face down on the table. If you have been playing blind and decide to look at your cards, you discard one after looking at them.\nFive Card Brag\nThis is similar to Four Card Brag, but five cards are dealt to each player, and everyone discards two cards to make their best three card brag hand.\nWild Cards\nBrag is sometimes played with wild cards, also known as floaters. The cards that are considered wild (if any) vary from group to group, so if you wish to play with wild cards it is important to agree the details before playing. Some possibilities are:\n\nAll twos wild;\nOnly the black twos wild;\nOne eyed jacks wild - namely the J and J which are drawn in profile with one eye visible on standard British playing-cards.\n\nSuicide king wild - this is the K whose sword is held in a position where it appears to pass through his head;\nA joker or jokers can be added to the pack to serve as wild cards.\n\nA wild card can be used to represent any card in the pack, but if two hands are otherwise equal, a hand without wild cards will beat a hand containing one or more wild cards, and a hand with fewer wild cards will beat a hand with more of them. For example, if W denotes a wild card, W-8-7 (with W representing the 9) beats 8-7-6, which beats 8-W-6. Also K-K-W beats K-W-W, which beats Q-Q-Q.\nIt seems that wild cards are often used in four-card and five-card brag, but that three card brag is more often played without them.\nVariations\nSome play that when there are just two players betting, you only need to equal the most recent bet to see the other player\'s cards (provided that he is not betting blind). Seeing does not cost a double bet.\nSome play that after the deal, the remainder of the pack is placed face up on the table, so that just one card (which was the bottom card during the deal) can be seen. Folded hands are then placed face up on top of the pack, again with just one card showing.\nPhill Rogers reports a version where when the deal has passed a full circle (i.e. one more deal than the number of players) then the next dealer gets to choose the game.  A change in variation (what cards are wild; whether blind betting is allowed; whether three four or five cards are dealt) can be dictated by the dealer; changing to a different card game, such as from Brag to Indian Poker, would have to be agreed by majority of players.\nMany books, especially in the late nineteenth and throughout the twentieth century, describe an entirely fictitious form of Brag with poker-like betting and three wild cards or "braggers"(A, J and 9). There is no evidence that Brag has ever been played that way, and it seems that this version derives from a misreading of some of the early printed descriptions. This is discussed further in Jeffrey Burton in The Playing-Card Vol XXIV No 3 (Nov-Dec 1995) and 4 (Jan-Feb 1996).\nOther sites, software and online games\nThere are several Indian sites offering online real money games of the almost identical Indian game Teen Patti (3 cards).\nDraw Brag with Poker Betting\nTo reduce the possibility of collusion in an online game, GameAccount has introduced a variation which they call "3 Card Brag Poker", which has poker-like betting and a draw. Before the deal the two players to the left of the dealer place compulsory bets, called the small and big "blinds". After the deal there is a poker-like betting round with fixed bets and raises equal to twice the big blind and a limit of three raises if there are more than two players in the pot. Then each player can discard from zero to three cards and is dealt replacement cards, after which there is a second betting round in which the bets and raises are twice as big, but again limited to three raises so long as there are more than two active players. Players do not have to look at the cards they are dealt, and so long as the play without seeing their cards they may call for half price.

It is sometimes said to be similar to poker, but in fact it is much older and the method of betting is different. The basic game of three-card Brag was one of the games described by Hoyle, and therefore dates from the late eighteenth century or earlier. It is almost identical to the popular Indian game Teen Pathi ("three cards").\nOn this page, Three Card Brag and its Four-card and Five-card variations will be described. There are other games known as 6-card, 7-card, 9-card and 13-card Brag; but they have a very different mechanism and will are covered on a separate page.\nThis page has been put together from a variety of sources, and I am grateful to those who have contributed, including: Jon Garibaldi, Thomas Olsson, Dave Phillips, Jamie Prestidge, Chris Roberts, Phill Rogers, Brian Rollo, Justin Thurkettle, Mike Tobias.\nThree Card Brag\nPlayers, cards and preparation\nA standard 52 card pack without jokers is used. The cards in each suit rank in the usual order from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. The number of players can vary, but it is probably best for about 4 to 8 people.\nThree Card Brag is a gambling game. Before starting it is essential that the players agree on the stake and have a common understanding of the rules. It is necessary to agree:\n\n\nthe initial stake or ante - which is the amount (if any) that everyone must put into the pot before each deal;\nthe minimum and maximum initial bet - the amount that the first player bets in order to stay in the hand;\nthe limit (if any) on the amount by which the bet can be increased by each subsequent player;\nany variations to the basic rules, such as use of wild cards.\n\n\nRanking of hands\nThe order of the possible three-card Brag hands, from highest to lowest, is as follows.\n\nCombinationExamplesExplanation\nPrial3-3-3A-A-A. . .2-2-2"Prial" - short for "pair royal" - is the name in Brag for a set of three cards of equal rank. The best is threes, and the other prials follow in the rank order of the cards: A-A-A, K-K-K, Q-Q-Q, etc. down to 5-5-5, 4-4-4, 2-2-2, three twos being the lowest prial.\nRunning flush3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2A running flush is a set of three consecutive cards of the same suit. A run is a set of three consecutive cards of mixed suits. Although the ace is high, A-2-3 counts as a valid run - or a valid running flush if all the cards are the same suit. In fact A-2-3 is the highest run or running flush, A-K-Q of a suit is the second highest, then K-Q-J, and so on down to 4-3-2, which is the lowest. 2-A-K is not a valid run or running flush.\nAny running flush beats any run with mixed suits - so for example 4-3-2 beats 3-2-A or A-K-Q. \nRun3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2\nFlushA-K-J. . .5-3-2A flush consists of three cards of the same suit - not all consecutive, or it would be a running flush. When comparing flushes, the highest card is compared first, then if these are equal the middle card, and finally if necessary the lowest. Therefore K-9-2 beats Q-10-5, which beats Q-10-3, which beats Q-9-8.\nPairA-A-K. . .2-2-3A pair consists of two cards of equal rank. The third card is of a different rank, otherwise you would have a prial. When comparing pairs, the rank of the pair is compared first (aces are highest), and if two players have the same pair the odd card determines which and is higher. So for example 9-9-3 beats 8-8-K, which beats 8-8-J.\nHigh cardA-K-J. . .5-3-2Three cards that do not form any of the above combinations. As with flushes, these rank according to the highest card; if the highest cards of two hands are equal the second highest cards are compared, and if these are equal too then the third highest. So J-6-3 beats 10-9-7, which beats 10-9-6.\n\nThere is no order of suits, so it is possible for two hands to be equal in rank - for example 7-7-Q is equal to 7-7-Q. In a contest between two equal hands the calling player (the player who paid to see the other hand) loses (see betting, below).\nPoker players should take care to note that the \'run\' and \'flush\' in Brag rank in the opposite order to Poker.\nAnte and deal\nBefore each deal, each player must place the agreed initial stake (ante) in the pot. Deal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.\nIf it is the first deal of the session, the dealer shuffles. For subsequent deals, the cards are only shuffled if the previous hand was "seen" and won by a prial. Apart from that, the cards not normally shuffled between hands. The cards from the previous hand are just added to the bottom of the pack and the dealer deals the new hands from the top, without shuffling.\nThe dealer deals out the cards one at a time, face down to the players, until everyone has three cards. Players may look at their own cards, or may choose not to, if they wish to play "blind" - see below. Cards must at never be shown to any player other than the person to whom they were dealt, unless the betting ends with a "see". In that case the cards of the two players involved (but none of the others) are exposed for everyone to see.\nNote: the practice of not shuffling makes it possible in some circumstances to know what cards are in play when the same cards come around again.\nThe betting\nWhen the cards have been dealt, the betting begins with the player to the left of the dealer. This person can \'fold\' (throw in their cards and take no further part in the hand) or can bet any amount from the agreed minimum to the agreed maximum. If all the players except one fold, the last remaining player takes all the money in the pot, and the next hand is dealt.\nIf any player bets, every player after that must either fold or bet at least as much as the previous player who bet. A player may bet more than the previous player, but there may be an agreed limit to the amount by which the bet can be increased. The betting continues around the table as many times as necessary.\nWhen there are only two players left in the game, all the others having folded, a third option becomes available. Either player can see the other. Seeing costs twice as much as the previous player\'s bet. When you pay to see another player, they expose their three cards first. If your cards are better than your opponent\'s, you expose your hand to prove this and win the pot. If your cards are equal to your opponent\'s or worse, your opponent wins the pot - you do not have to show your cards in this case. Note that if the hands are equal, the player who paid to see loses.\nPoker players should notice that there is no concept of equalising the bets. At each turn, to stay in you have to put into the pot at least as much new money as the previous player put in. Here are some examples from a four player game:\n\nPlayer A bets 2 chips, B folds, C bets 2 chips and D bets 2 chips. In order to stay in, A would have to bet another 2 chips.\nPlayer A bets 2 chips, B folds, C bets 4 chips and D folds. Player A can now see player C by paying 8 chips (twice C\'s bet) or pay at least 4 chips to stay in, or fold, allowing C to win the pot. If A pays 4 to stay in, C now has the same options: put 8 in the pot to see A, to bet at least 4 and allow A another turn to bet, or to fold and allow A to win.\n\nBetting continues until either \n\nall players but one have dropped out (folded) (in which case the remaining player obviously wins, but does not show their cards), or \ntwo players are left and one player pays double to see the other.\n\nAs each player folds, that player\'s cards are added to the bottom of the pack ready for the next deal. At the end of the betting the cards of the last player left in, or the cards of the two players involved in the see, are added to the pack in the same way.\nPlease note the following basic rules of etiquette:\n\nDo not show your cards - to anybody\nDo not say anything about your hand\nNever (ever) fold out of turn\n\nBreaking any of the above three rules will get you thrown out of any Brag game.\nHere is an example of betting between five players:\n\nRoundAndyBillChrisDanEddie\n1\t111fold2\n2222-2\n3222-2\n42fold2-5\n55-5-5\n65-5-5\n75-fold-10\n810---10\n910---10\n1020 (to see)\n\nPoints to note\n\nAndy bets 1 (one) first round, Bill and Chris match 1, Eddie raises to 2. Andy (A) now must bet 2 to stay in, regardless of the fact that he has already put 1 (one) in. Similar for B and C.\nThe betting can remain at 2 (e.g. rounds 1-4) indefinitely. If everyone is staying in, eventually someone (e.g. E) must force the pace.\nIn rounds 5 and 6 A, C and E are all in. No-one can see, and all must remain. In situations like this, it is simply a matter of nerve. Someone must fold for the betting to end - and eventually C does.\n\nWhen there are only two remaining (A and E, rounds 8-10), then either can decide to pay double to \'see\'. When A bets 20 to \'see\' on round 10, \the must say \'See you\' (or equivalent). It is perfectly acceptable to double the betting without \'seeing\', in which case the game continues as normal.\n\nA common (but not necessary) house limit on raising is to agree that no-one can raise the pot by more than its current contents. So, for a five player game, the maximum initial stake would be 5 times the ante.\nRunning out of money\nBrag is seldom played with what Poker players know as table stakes (where players keep the money they are playing with on the table for everyone to see and cannot introduce extra money into the game except between hands and with the agreement of all the players). Brag players often keep their money in their pockets until needed. It is usual to insist that each player wishing to take part in a game should placed at least a certain minimum amount of money on the table - say 10. After that, players are free to introduce more money to the game at any time.\nSome play that if you do not have enough money left to bet, but want to stay in, you place all your remaining money in the pot, and put your cards face down on top of it. This is called covering the pot. If there are two or more other players, they continue betting as before, but putting the money into a new pot. After this new pot is settled, the winner\'s hand is exposed, and the hand of the player who ran out of money is compared with it. The old pot is won by the higher hand, or by the winner of the new pot in case of a tie.\nThe method of covering the pot can also be used when there are only two players left in the game. If one of the players runs out of money, the betting ends when one player puts the last of his money in the pot - the other player does not have to put in any more money but exposes his cards, and wins the pot unless the player who ran out of money can show a better hand.\nAlthough covering the pot might seem to work unfairly in favour of the player who runs out of money, thus getting to see the opponent\'s hand cheaply, it does avoid some undesirable situations.\nHowever, according to the information I have received from Brag players, it is quite usual to play the harsher rule that a player who does not have enough money to bet the full amount required must either fold or borrow money from another player or a bystander to make up the bet. For this purpose, the player is allowed to show his cards to a player who has already dropped out, who might be prepared to back him financially. Sometimes there is an agreement that whoever in the game has most money will lend some to the player who is short to allow that player to continue to bet.\nSome people play that when only two players are in the game, and one of them runs out of money, the player who still has money has the choice of either\n\nlending some money to the other player to allow betting to continue, or\nshowing his cards, in which case he wins the pot unless the other player can show a better hand.\n\nIt is clear that betting with borrowing could potentially lead to some difficult situations, in which a player must either fold a good hand or borrow money he may not be in a position to repay. When blind betting is allowed, there is even more scope for this kind of problem, since a blind player can carry on betting indefinitely against an open player, and the open player cannot see the blind player.\nSometimes, in a situation where three (or more) players are betting against each other and none of them is prepared to fold, if they all feel that the pot is getting too big, they may agree to a showdown in which all cards are exposed and the highest hand wins.\nI would like to hear from any experienced Brag players who can let me know more about the correct way to handle these situations.\nPlaying blind\nExperienced players usually allow the extra option of playing blind. Any player may choose to play any hand blind. If you are playing blind you do not look at your cards, but leave them face down on the table. You take part in the betting in the normal way, except that all your bets are worth double. In other words, at each stage you only have to put in half the amount of money you would need to bet if you had looked at your cards.\nIf you have been playing blind, then at your turn to bet, you can choose to look at your cards before deciding whether to bet or fold. From that moment on you are no longer a blind player, and if you then want to stay in, you must revert to the same betting amount as the \'non-blind\' players.\nIf you are playing blind and all the other players fold - which would be surprising but I am assured that it does happen - you do not win the pot. Instead, the pot is carried forward to the next deal and you are allowed to retain your hand - see below.\nWhen just two players remain, one or both of whom are playing blind, the possibilities for one player to "see" the other - i.e. pay for the hands to be exposed and compared - are as follows.\n\nYou are playing open and your opponent is blind. The rule is that "you cannot see a blind man". Therefore your only options are to continue betting or to fold. \nBoth players are blind. By putting in twice the blind stake (i.e. the amount that would be paid by an open player) you can cause the hands to be compared. Usually the players turn their cards face up one at a time, alternately, beginning with the opponent of the player who paid for the show. In case of equality, as usual, the player who paid for the show loses.\nYou are playing blind but your opponent is playing open. Your opponent cannot see you (by the above rule), but you can see your opponent if you wish by putting in twice the blind stake (i.e. the same amount that your open opponent just bet). As usual in a showdown, the opponent\'s cards are exposed first and then you show your cards if they are better.\nA betting example:\n\nRoundAndyBillChrisDanEddie\n111 (blind)21 (blind)\t2\n221 (blind)21 (blind)\t2\n321 (blind)21 (blind)2\n421 (blind)42 (blind)fold\n545 (blind)10fold-\n6fold5 (blind)10--\n7-5 (blind)10--\n8-10 (to see)\n\nPoints to note:\n\nB must pay double the blind stake to \'see\' C\'s hand. C is not allowed to see B in round 6 or 7, even though only two players are left.\n\nNote how after 4 rounds B has only spent 4 chips compared to C who has spent 10. This type of inequity often happens when playing with blind hands, and is part of the whole essence of the procedure.\nLooking at a \'blind\' hand out of turn is another Brag \'faux-pas\' which will get other Brag players (very) annoyed. The reason is that (for example) during round 4, when C raises to 4, if B now looks at his cards it has immediately changed the basis of A\'s decision as to whether to stay in or fold on his turn. He would then have only one \'blind\' opponent (as D stays \'blind\'), instead of potentially two \'blind\' opponents (D and possibly B).\n\nRetaining a blind hand\nIf you end up with a blind hand when all other players have dropped out, you may retain the blind hand on the table. The next hand is then dealt, so that you now have two sets of cards in front of you. You may either:\n\nlook at the new hand\nlook at the old hand\nlook at neither\n\nIf you look at one of the hands, you must immediately decide whether to keep it or fold it. If you keep it, you must fold the other (without looking at it). You are then non-blind and play the looked-at hand normally. If you decide to fold the hand you looked at, then you have just one blind hand to play by the usual rules; you can look at it now or later if you wish.\nIf you look at neither hand, you can play both hands \'blind\' until (at some point) you choose to look at one of them, in which case you follow the same procedure above.\nIn the unlikely event that you win the pot again, without having looked at either \'blind\' hand,\nyou may choose to retain either (but only one), sight unseen, before the next deal. You cannot have three \'blind\' hands at once.\nNote that at no stage when playing two hands \'blind\' can you look at both and choose the better one - you must look at just one and choose to keep it or fold it, before looking at the other.\nVariation\nSome groups treat retained blind hands differently. The player who won blind is dealt a second hand face up, while everyone else is dealt a hand face down as usual. The other players must look at their hands and anyone who cannot beat the face up hand must fold. If all have folded, the player with the retained blind hand collects the antes, keeps the blind hand, and the next player deals. If a player or players stay in, then the face up hand is discarded and the the retained blind hand plays against the others in the usual way, with the normal betting rules and procedure for looking at the blind hand. If the player with the blind hand wins again by everyone folding, he will again be dealt a face up hand alongside the retained blind hand. This continues until the blind player has looked at his blind hand, after which the play reverts to normal.\nThe odds\nJon Garibaldi has provided the following analysis.\nAs there are so few total different hands, it is not difficult to calculate the prior probabilities.\nThere are a total of 22,100 different card combinations (52*51*50/3!). The number of ways to make each hand, and approx odds, are as follows:\n\nHandCombinationsProbabilityOdds\nPrial Threes41/55255524 to 1\nOther Prial481/460459 to 1\nRunning Flush48\t1/460459 to 1\nRun7201/3130 to 1\nFlush10961/2019 to 1\nPair37441/65 to 1\nHigh Card164403/43 to 1 on\n(total combinations)22100\n\nObviously, these odds are affected by previous cards, if the deck isn\'t shuffled.\nAdvice on play\nJohn Garibaldi has contributed the following advice.\n\nStudy the odds carefully and remember them.\nPlay by the odds.\nDon\'t stick rigidly to playing by the odds!! You will lose very quickly, and never win a big pot if you never bluff.\nPlaying \'blind\' well is very difficult and takes years of practice. If you play it too often, and non-expertly you will lose.\nDon\'t bet too big, especially if you are used to Poker betting. As the Brag betting can continue indefinitely, on the same amount (and indeed must, until there are only two players) the pot can get very large even when each single bet seems low.\n\nFour Card Brag\nThis is the same game as Three Card Brag, except that four cards are dealt to each player. Players who look at their hands discard one card before the betting begins to form the best three card hand they can make. In case of a tie between two hands, the discarded card is used to decide which is better. If the discarded cards were also equal in rank then the player who was seen wins the tie.\nIf betting blind is allowed, a blind player will keep all four cards face down on the table. If you have been playing blind and decide to look at your cards, you discard one after looking at them.\nFive Card Brag\nThis is similar to Four Card Brag, but five cards are dealt to each player, and everyone discards two cards to make their best three card brag hand.\nWild Cards\nBrag is sometimes played with wild cards, also known as floaters. The cards that are considered wild (if any) vary from group to group, so if you wish to play with wild cards it is important to agree the details before playing. Some possibilities are:\n\nAll twos wild;\nOnly the black twos wild;\nOne eyed jacks wild - namely the J and J which are drawn in profile with one eye visible on standard British playing-cards.\n\nSuicide king wild - this is the K whose sword is held in a position where it appears to pass through his head;\nA joker or jokers can be added to the pack to serve as wild cards.\n\nA wild card can be used to represent any card in the pack, but if two hands are otherwise equal, a hand without wild cards will beat a hand containing one or more wild cards, and a hand with fewer wild cards will beat a hand with more of them. For example, if W denotes a wild card, W-8-7 (with W representing the 9) beats 8-7-6, which beats 8-W-6. Also K-K-W beats K-W-W, which beats Q-Q-Q.\nIt seems that wild cards are often used in four-card and five-card brag, but that three card brag is more often played without them.\nVariations\nSome play that when there are just two players betting, you only need to equal the most recent bet to see the other player\'s cards (provided that he is not betting blind). Seeing does not cost a double bet.\nSome play that after the deal, the remainder of the pack is placed face up on the table, so that just one card (which was the bottom card during the deal) can be seen. Folded hands are then placed face up on top of the pack, again with just one card showing.\nPhill Rogers reports a version where when the deal has passed a full circle (i.e. one more deal than the number of players) then the next dealer gets to choose the game.  A change in variation (what cards are wild; whether blind betting is allowed; whether three four or five cards are dealt) can be dictated by the dealer; changing to a different card game, such as from Brag to Indian Poker, would have to be agreed by majority of players.\nMany books, especially in the late nineteenth and throughout the twentieth century, describe an entirely fictitious form of Brag with poker-like betting and three wild cards or "braggers"(A, J and 9). There is no evidence that Brag has ever been played that way, and it seems that this version derives from a misreading of some of the early printed descriptions. This is discussed further in Jeffrey Burton in The Playing-Card Vol XXIV No 3 (Nov-Dec 1995) and 4 (Jan-Feb 1996).\nOther sites, software and online games\nThere are several Indian sites offering online real money games of the almost identical Indian game Teen Patti (3 cards).\nDraw Brag with Poker Betting\nTo reduce the possibility of collusion in an online game, GameAccount has introduced a variation which they call "3 Card Brag Poker", which has poker-like betting and a draw. Before the deal the two players to the left of the dealer place compulsory bets, called the small and big "blinds". After the deal there is a poker-like betting round with fixed bets and raises equal to twice the big blind and a limit of three raises if there are more than two players in the pot. Then each player can discard from zero to three cards and is dealt replacement cards, after which there is a second betting round in which the bets and raises are twice as big, but again limited to three raises so long as there are more than two active players. Players do not have to look at the cards they are dealt, and so long as the play without seeing their cards they may call for half price.

A point is scored by the winner of each three-card hand, and the first to an agreed target score wins the game. Unlike Three Card Brag, on which the hand patterns are based, Crash and the other games on this page are not high stake gambling games. They are usually played for a small amount of money, and there is no process of betting to raise the stake.\nCrash\nI am grateful to the many people who have contributed information about Crash, including: Bob Allison, David Calvert, Matt Daligan, Ben Hall, David Jennings, Robert Jones, Stephen Lowry, Allister Paterson, Peter Rollinson, Tom Valentine and Stephen Williams.\nThe game of Crash is also known as Thirteen Card Brag. It is played over a large part of the north of England and in Wales - I have reports ranging from Coventry and Burton-on-Trent in the south to Cumbria and Yorkshire in the north, from Welshpool and from South Wales; also one report from Plymouth and one from Edinburgh, where the game was known as Crackers. There are numerous variations in the rules. I will try to list all those I have collected, and would be interested in comments and in further reports of places where Crash is played and the versions in use.\nPlayers, cards and deal\nCrash is essentially a four player game. It is played with a standard 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen at random. One method is to deal the cards around face up: the first player who receives a seven is the first dealer. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts, and the dealer deals out all the cards clockwise, one at a time, so that everyone has 13 cards. After the cards have been played and scored, the turn to deal passes to the left.\nIt is possible for three people to play. In this case four 13-card hands are still dealt: three to the players and one face-down spare hand. Starting with the player to dealer\'s left, each player in turn then has the option to discard their hand and take the spare hand in exchange (without first knowing what the spare hand contains). Some play that anyone exchanging for the spare hand must put an additional stake in the pool which will be taken by the eventual winner of the game.\nIf two people wish to play, there will be two spare hands, and each player may keep the hand they are dealt or exchange it sight unseen for one of the spares.\nThe Play\nEach player divides their 13 cards into up to four three-card Brag hands, which are placed face down in front of the player in descending order from left to right. The card or cards remaining are set aside.\nThe valid three-card hands in descending order are:\n\nPrial: three cards of the same rank - threes highest, then aces, kings, etc.\nRunning Flush, also known as a \'run on the bounce\' or a trotter: three consecutive cards in one suit - 3-2-A highest, then A-K-Q, down to 4-3-2 (lowest)\nRun: three consecutive cards of mixed suits - ranking as for running flushes.\nFlush: three cards of the same suit (ace high)\nPair: two cards of the same rank with any third card (aces high)\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Brag hands, these combinations are explained in more detail at the end of this page.\nNote that three unrelated cards - all different ranks, mixed suits and not consecutive - do not form a valid hand. Normally you arrange your 13 cards into four 3-card hands and discard the last card, but in some cases you be unable or unwilling to make as many as four valid hands from your 13 cards. In that case you just make as many hands as you wish - perhaps only two or three - and discard your remaining cards.\nWhen all are ready, everyone reveals their leftmost 3-card hand (highest hand), and the best of these hands scores a point. Then everyone reveals their second hand and the best of the second hands again scores a point, then the same again for the third hands and the fourth hands.\nIt can happen that there is a tie for best hand - for example two players have equally high runs with different suits. This is called a stick-up or a stopper, and no one scores the corresponding point.\nYou must always place your 3-card hands in descending order from left to right. Anyone who places a better hand to the right of a worse hand (so unfairly increasing their chance of winning one of the later points) automatically loses the game. Also, if you make fewer than four hands, the hands that you do make must always compete for the earliest points - for example the first three points if you made three hands.\nScoring\nDifferent target scores are used in different places - some play to 7 points; some to 10, 11, 13 or even 21. The target score may be increased if there are fewer than 4 players - for example 4 players play to 11 points, two or three play to 15. In South Wales, the game is played to 12 points, but the leader must be 2 points ahead of the second placed player to win; if not, play continues until someone achieves a 2-point lead.\n\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the target. This may happen before all the hands have been compared. For example, in a 7-point game, if two players have 6, and one of them wins the first (left) hand of the next deal, that player has won the game by reaching 7 first, even if the second player had the best of the second, third and fourth hands.\nIn some places the score is kept on paper. Sometimes a special peg-board is used: illustrated to the right are two designs for the 7-point game from Salford and Coventry; players start from the corners and the winner is the first to reach the centre hole. Some score on a cribbage board, each player using one of the four tracks, starting from one end, the aim of course being to reach the agreed target score first.\nThe winner of the game is paid by the other three players. Some use a fixed payment per game - such as 50p; others play that each pays the winner an amount (for example 1p or 2p) for each point that they are short of the target. In either case, some play that anyone who scored no points at all during the game must pay double. Some play that if all three opponents of the winner scored zero points, the payment for game is trebled.\nThe Crash\nA crash occurs when one player wins all four points in a deal. This is rewarded with an extra score, which should be agreed on before playing, because it varies from place to place.\n\nSome play that a crash wins the current game outright.\nIn some places a crash is worth just one extra point - five points instead of the usual four.\nSome play that a crash wins four points towards the current game, and in addition the player who crashed is paid an extra stake (usually equal to the value of a game) by each opponent.\n\nSome play that a crash is only valid if the player announces it after everyone has set their hands, but before any cards are exposed. In this version of the game, a player who wins all four hands without having said \'crash\' just scores four points towards the current game. The player attempting crash should check that everyone is ready before announcing it; no rearrangement of hands is allowed after the announcement. Again, there are various ways of scoring:\n\nSome play that an announced crash wins the current game if successful. If a player announces crash but then fails to win all four hands, the player scores nothing for that deal.\nSome award an extra payment outside the game for a successful announced crash. If you announce crash and fail to win all four hands you have to pay the other players the amount you would have won. For example in a 10-point game where the winner is paid 2p per point difference, a player announcing a crash receives 20p from each opponent in addition to the 4 points if it succeeds; if it fails, the player scores points as usual for any hands won, but has to pay 20p to each opponent for the crash.\n\nIf a player reaches the target score before all four sets of hands have been compared, the game is over, and there can be no crash, even if the same player would have won the remaining hands. Therefore, in the version where you are paid extra for a successful announced crash, you should be careful not to announce it when you need 3 or fewer points to win: you would be certain to fail, as the game would end before you had won your four hands.\nSpecial hands\nThe following special hands are usually but not always recognised. The details should be agreed before playing.\n\nFour of a kind\nIf you have all four cards of one rank and include them all in the 3-card hands you play, this is known as a bus ride or a poppy, which scores an extra point. (It does not matter whether any of your hands actually win, as long as they include all of your four equal cards.) Usually there is also an extra payment, to be agreed in advance. When playing a fixed payment per game the extra payment could be the value of a game; when the payment is 2p per point difference, a bus ride could be worth 5p or 10p or 20p from each player, according to agreement.\nIf two or more players have bus rides, only the highest scores. For this purpose only, four fours are highest, then aces, kings, queens, etc. down to fives, threes, twos.\nSome play that in order to score or be paid for a bus ride, you must knock (or "chap") when you first receive your cards, to warn the other players that you have four of a kind before they select their 3-card hands.\nIn South Wales, some play that four of a kind (or the best four of a kind if there is more than one) wins all four points for the deal, and the cards are not played. Four fours win the game outright.\n\nPairs\nA player who is dealt six pairs can show them and demand a new deal by the same dealer. This is not compulsory - if you can make some runs you might prefer to play the hand, but if you choose to declare the pairs instead of playing, this has precedence over all other actions and payments. For example a declaration of pairs has priority over a four of a kind or a crash announcement.\nSome play that only five pairs are needed to demand a redeal.\n\nThirteen card run\nA player who has one card of each rank (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K) can choose to declare this instead of playing the hand and according to prior agreement it either wins the current game outright, or entitles the holder to a payment. The payment could be equal to the stake for the game, or equal to the value of 10 points, if payments to the winner of the game are according to difference in points. If a 13 card run is declared the hand is not played, and the deal passes to the next player.\n\nFurther Variations\n\nOptional shuffle\nSome play that the dealer may choose not to shuffle; in this case the dealer must alert the other players that the cards are not shuffled. Also, the player to dealer\'s right may choose not to cut. If there is no shuffle, players who remember the previous deal may be able to estimate how the cards are distributed in the new deal.\n\nYogi or Chas\nIn this version, in case of a tie for a point, the point is awarded to a fictional player known as Yogi (in Yorkshire) or Chas (in Lincolnshire). At the end of the game, anyone whose score is equal to or below Yogi/Chas\'s score has to pay the winner double. (This replaces the rule whereby a player with no points at all must pay double). If Yogi or Chas wins the game (having more points at the end than any of the real players), then everyone pays the cost of the game into a pool, which goes to the winner of the next game.\n\nResetting to zero\nIn this variation, if a player declares six pairs or a thirteen card run from ace to king, the scores of the other three players are reduced to zero, while the score of the declaring player stays as it is. The cards are then thrown in and the next dealer deals. \nA player who holds one of these hands might choose not to declare it but to play the cards instead. This will often be sensible if the other players have no points or very few points to lose - a thirteen card run can be played as four runs, some of which may be on the bounce, so it should bring in at least one point.\n\nNo pairs\nIn some places, a pair is not a valid hand. The lowest playable three-card hand is a flush.\n\nNine Card Brag\nNine Card Brag can be played by up to five people. Everyone pays a stake to the pool and nine cards are dealt to each player. \n\nIf anyone has four of a kind, they show it and the best four of a kind wins the pot. \nIf anyone has four pairs, they can show them and "save the game". No one wins the pot, each player contributes another stake to it, and the next player deals.\nWinning the pot with four of a kind has priority over saving the game with four pairs.\n\nIf no one declares four of a kind or four pairs, each player divides their nine cards into three three-card Brag hands, placing the highest of these face down to their left, the lowest to their right and the middle hand between them. The left hands are exposed first, beginning with the player to dealer\'s left. Whoever has the best left hand begins exposing the middle hands, and whoever has the best of these begins exposing the right hands. Hands are always exposed in turn, going clockwise around the table. If there is a tie for best hand in any of the three rounds, the player who was first to expose the best hand wins that hand and is first to expose the next hand.\nThe ranking of Brag hands is as listed below, except that most play that the highest prial or is a set of nines, second is a set of aces, and other prials follow in the natural order: kings, queens, jacks, 10s, 8s, 7s, 6s, 5s, 4s, 3s, 2s. Fours of a kind rank in the same order as prials.\nA set of three cards which are not a run, flush or pair can also be played as a hand, and if all players play this, the highest card wins (if two or more people have the same highest card, the second highest card is compared, and if these are also equal, the third card).\nTo win the pot, a player must win at least two hands of the three hands. If three players win one hand each, the game is "saved" - that is, the pot is carried over to the next deal, and each player must contribute a further stake to it.\nVariations of Nine-Card Brag\nMany play that the pot is only won if a single player wins or at least ties all three hands. In this version the order in which the hands are exposed is not significant. If the same players tie as winners of all three hands, or if no player is best or equal best in all three hands, no one wins and the pot is carried forward to the next deal, everyone adding another stake.\nSome play that a prial of threes or a prial of sevens, rather than nines, is highest.\nSome play that after looking at his hand, the dealer can decide to deal a tenth card to each player. Each player must then discard one card and the play proceeds as usual. This gives the dealer a slight advantage, in that the other players have no say over whether the tenth card is dealt.\nSome play that if you consider you have no chance of winning you can call a "bum deal" and "pack" (i.e. throw in) your cards - this has no real effect on the game - the others play as usual, and you are entitled to play your cards rather than packing, however bad they are.\nSome play that four pairs have priority over four of a kind.\nSome play that a nine card running flush beats four of a kind. \nVictor Wakefield reports a version in which two jokers are added to the pack, allowing six people to play. A joker can be used to represent a specific rank or a specific suit - so it can be used to make a prial or a run or a flush, but not a running flush. Between two otherwise equal hands, one made of natural cards beats one containing a joker. When used in a flush, the joker always counts as the lowest card of its suit - so for example 7-4-joker beats 7-3-2, which in turn beats 7-3-joker.\nIn the six player game with two jokers, all the cards are dealt, but it is still possible to play the variant where the dealer can deal a tenth card as follows. If a player calls a "bum deal", then the dealer may shuffle that player\'s cards and deal one each to the remaining five players. These players each discard a card and the discards along with the undealt cards of the bum deal hand can be taken by the player who called the bum deal and played as a hand.\nSome play that jokers are exactly equivalent to the card they substitute for - wild cards are not inferior to natural ones. So 10-9-8 and 10-joker-8 are equal hands the first exposed would win. Nevertheless, in this version, jokers cannot be used to claim the pot by making four of a kind - only a natural four of a kind wins outright.\nSome play that declaring four pairs has priority over declaring four of a kind.\nNine-Card Brag is sometimes played for points, rather than with a pot for each deal. In that case the points scored in each deal are as follows:\n\n3 points for 4 of a kind, or\n1 point for saving the game (4 pair), or\n4 points for winning all three 3-card hands, or\n1 point for each 3-card hand won (if no one wins all three)\n\nA target number of points is set, and the player who first reaches or passes the target wins the pot. Alternatively a time limit can be set after which a fixed number of deals is played, for example "last 4 deals" could be called at 7.30 pm.  \n  In this game a player cannot win the pot by saving the game. If a player achieves the highest score by saving the game in the last deal, another deal must be played.\n  \n\nIn the point scoring version with a target score, some play that a player who has four of a kind can choose to peg six points or to set all the other players back six points.\nSix Card Brag\nEveryone contributes an agreed stake to the pot, and the dealer deals out 6 cards to each player, one at a time. If anyone has four cards of the same rank they declare this immediately and the best four of a kind wins.\nIf no one has four of a kind, each player divides their six cards into two three-card Brag hands, placing them face-down on the table with the higher on the left and the lower on the right. The player to dealer\'s left begins by exposing his left hand. The other players in turn either pass or expose their left hands. Whoever has the best left hand (or the first of these if there is a tie) then exposes his right hand. The other players in turn do the same or pass.\nThe ranking of Brag hands is as listed below, except that most play that the highest prial or is a set of sixes, second is a set of aces, and other prials follow in the natural order: kings, queens, jacks, 10s, 9s, 8s, 7s, 5s, 4s, 3s, 2s. Fours of a kind rank in the same order.\nA set of three cards which are not a run, flush or pair can also be played as a hand, and if all players play this, the highest card wins (if two or more people have the same highest card, the second highest card is compared, and if these are also equal, the third card).\nIf one player has the highest left hand and the highest right hand, or wins one of these and ties the other, or ties for best with both hands, that player wins the pot. If the same two players tie for best left hand and for best right hand then they split the pot equally between them. In any other case, no one wins, and the pot is carried forward to the next deal, everyone adding another stake.\nVariation: some play that a six-card running flush - for example 3-4-5-6-7-8-9 of one suit - wins the hand, beating four of a kind.\nSeven Card Brag\nThis game is the same as Six Card Brag, except for the following.\n\nSeven cards are dealt to each player.\nIf no one has four of a kind, each player discards one card face down before dividing the remaining six into a left hand and a right hand.\nThe highest prial or four of a kind is a set of sevens, others ranking in their natural order - so the order of precedence for prials and fours of a kind is 7-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-6-5-4-3-2.\nSome play that a seven card running flush beats four of a kind. \n\n\n\nRank of Brag hands\nThe order of the possible three-card Brag hands, from highest to lowest, is as follows.\n\nCombinationExamplesExplanation\nPrial3-3-3A-A-A. . .2-2-2"Prial" - short for "pair royal" - is the name in Brag for a set of three cards of equal rank. The best is usually a prial of threes, though in some variations some other prial is best (this will be specified in the rules for the relevant game). The remaining prials follow in the rank order of the cards: A-A-A, K-K-K, Q-Q-Q, etc. down to 2-2-2, three twos being the lowest prial.\nRunning flushorRun on the bounce3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2A running flush is a set of three consecutive cards of the same suit. A run is a set of three consecutive cards of mixed suits. Although the ace is high, A-2-3 counts as a valid run - or a valid running flush if all the cards are the same suit. In fact A-2-3 is the highest run or running flush, A-K-Q of a suit is the second highest, then K-Q-J, and so on down to 4-3-2, which is the lowest. 2-A-K is not a valid run or running flush.\nAny running flush beats any run with mixed suits - so for example 4-3-2 beats 3-2-A or A-K-Q. \nRun3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2\nFlushA-K-J. . .5-3-2A flush consists of three cards of the same suit - not all consecutive, or it would be a running flush. When comparing flushes, the highest card is compared first, then if these are equal the middle card, and finally if necessary the lowest. Therefore K-9-2 beats Q-10-5, which beats Q-10-3, which beats Q-9-8.\nPairA-A-K. . .2-2-3A pair consists of two cards of equal rank. The third card is of a different rank, otherwise you would have a prial. When comparing pairs, the rank of the pair is compared first, and if these are equal the odd card determines which is higher. So for example 9-9-3 beats 8-8-K, which beats 8-8-J.\n\nThe above are the only 3-card hands that are playable in Crash. In Three Card Brag, it is also possible to play three unmatched cards - cards that are not consecutive, not all of the same suit and contain no pair. These rank according to their highest card; if the highest cards of two hands are equal the second highest cards are compared, and if these are equal too then the third highest. So J-6-3 beats 10-9-7, which beats 10-9-6. An example of the highest unmatched set is A-K-J and of the lowest is 5-3-2. These unmatched sets can be used in 6-card, 7-card and 9-card Brag, but not in Crash.\nThere is no order of suits in Brag, so it is possible for two hands to be equal in rank - for example 7-7-Q is equal to 7-7-Q.\nPoker players should take care to note that a running flush (\'straight flush\') is beaten by a prial in this game, and that the \'run\' and \'flush\' in Brag rank in the opposite order to Poker.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Showdown games > Partition Games > Crash (13-card Brag)\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2000, 2001, 2003.

A point is scored by the winner of each three-card hand, and the first to an agreed target score wins the game. Unlike Three Card Brag, on which the hand patterns are based, Crash and the other games on this page are not high stake gambling games. They are usually played for a small amount of money, and there is no process of betting to raise the stake.\nCrash\nI am grateful to the many people who have contributed information about Crash, including: Bob Allison, David Calvert, Matt Daligan, Ben Hall, David Jennings, Robert Jones, Stephen Lowry, Allister Paterson, Peter Rollinson, Tom Valentine and Stephen Williams.\nThe game of Crash is also known as Thirteen Card Brag. It is played over a large part of the north of England and in Wales - I have reports ranging from Coventry and Burton-on-Trent in the south to Cumbria and Yorkshire in the north, from Welshpool and from South Wales; also one report from Plymouth and one from Edinburgh, where the game was known as Crackers. There are numerous variations in the rules. I will try to list all those I have collected, and would be interested in comments and in further reports of places where Crash is played and the versions in use.\nPlayers, cards and deal\nCrash is essentially a four player game. It is played with a standard 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen at random. One method is to deal the cards around face up: the first player who receives a seven is the first dealer. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts, and the dealer deals out all the cards clockwise, one at a time, so that everyone has 13 cards. After the cards have been played and scored, the turn to deal passes to the left.\nIt is possible for three people to play. In this case four 13-card hands are still dealt: three to the players and one face-down spare hand. Starting with the player to dealer\'s left, each player in turn then has the option to discard their hand and take the spare hand in exchange (without first knowing what the spare hand contains). Some play that anyone exchanging for the spare hand must put an additional stake in the pool which will be taken by the eventual winner of the game.\nIf two people wish to play, there will be two spare hands, and each player may keep the hand they are dealt or exchange it sight unseen for one of the spares.\nThe Play\nEach player divides their 13 cards into up to four three-card Brag hands, which are placed face down in front of the player in descending order from left to right. The card or cards remaining are set aside.\nThe valid three-card hands in descending order are:\n\nPrial: three cards of the same rank - threes highest, then aces, kings, etc.\nRunning Flush, also known as a \'run on the bounce\' or a trotter: three consecutive cards in one suit - 3-2-A highest, then A-K-Q, down to 4-3-2 (lowest)\nRun: three consecutive cards of mixed suits - ranking as for running flushes.\nFlush: three cards of the same suit (ace high)\nPair: two cards of the same rank with any third card (aces high)\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Brag hands, these combinations are explained in more detail at the end of this page.\nNote that three unrelated cards - all different ranks, mixed suits and not consecutive - do not form a valid hand. Normally you arrange your 13 cards into four 3-card hands and discard the last card, but in some cases you be unable or unwilling to make as many as four valid hands from your 13 cards. In that case you just make as many hands as you wish - perhaps only two or three - and discard your remaining cards.\nWhen all are ready, everyone reveals their leftmost 3-card hand (highest hand), and the best of these hands scores a point. Then everyone reveals their second hand and the best of the second hands again scores a point, then the same again for the third hands and the fourth hands.\nIt can happen that there is a tie for best hand - for example two players have equally high runs with different suits. This is called a stick-up or a stopper, and no one scores the corresponding point.\nYou must always place your 3-card hands in descending order from left to right. Anyone who places a better hand to the right of a worse hand (so unfairly increasing their chance of winning one of the later points) automatically loses the game. Also, if you make fewer than four hands, the hands that you do make must always compete for the earliest points - for example the first three points if you made three hands.\nScoring\nDifferent target scores are used in different places - some play to 7 points; some to 10, 11, 13 or even 21. The target score may be increased if there are fewer than 4 players - for example 4 players play to 11 points, two or three play to 15. In South Wales, the game is played to 12 points, but the leader must be 2 points ahead of the second placed player to win; if not, play continues until someone achieves a 2-point lead.\n\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the target. This may happen before all the hands have been compared. For example, in a 7-point game, if two players have 6, and one of them wins the first (left) hand of the next deal, that player has won the game by reaching 7 first, even if the second player had the best of the second, third and fourth hands.\nIn some places the score is kept on paper. Sometimes a special peg-board is used: illustrated to the right are two designs for the 7-point game from Salford and Coventry; players start from the corners and the winner is the first to reach the centre hole. Some score on a cribbage board, each player using one of the four tracks, starting from one end, the aim of course being to reach the agreed target score first.\nThe winner of the game is paid by the other three players. Some use a fixed payment per game - such as 50p; others play that each pays the winner an amount (for example 1p or 2p) for each point that they are short of the target. In either case, some play that anyone who scored no points at all during the game must pay double. Some play that if all three opponents of the winner scored zero points, the payment for game is trebled.\nThe Crash\nA crash occurs when one player wins all four points in a deal. This is rewarded with an extra score, which should be agreed on before playing, because it varies from place to place.\n\nSome play that a crash wins the current game outright.\nIn some places a crash is worth just one extra point - five points instead of the usual four.\nSome play that a crash wins four points towards the current game, and in addition the player who crashed is paid an extra stake (usually equal to the value of a game) by each opponent.\n\nSome play that a crash is only valid if the player announces it after everyone has set their hands, but before any cards are exposed. In this version of the game, a player who wins all four hands without having said \'crash\' just scores four points towards the current game. The player attempting crash should check that everyone is ready before announcing it; no rearrangement of hands is allowed after the announcement. Again, there are various ways of scoring:\n\nSome play that an announced crash wins the current game if successful. If a player announces crash but then fails to win all four hands, the player scores nothing for that deal.\nSome award an extra payment outside the game for a successful announced crash. If you announce crash and fail to win all four hands you have to pay the other players the amount you would have won. For example in a 10-point game where the winner is paid 2p per point difference, a player announcing a crash receives 20p from each opponent in addition to the 4 points if it succeeds; if it fails, the player scores points as usual for any hands won, but has to pay 20p to each opponent for the crash.\n\nIf a player reaches the target score before all four sets of hands have been compared, the game is over, and there can be no crash, even if the same player would have won the remaining hands. Therefore, in the version where you are paid extra for a successful announced crash, you should be careful not to announce it when you need 3 or fewer points to win: you would be certain to fail, as the game would end before you had won your four hands.\nSpecial hands\nThe following special hands are usually but not always recognised. The details should be agreed before playing.\n\nFour of a kind\nIf you have all four cards of one rank and include them all in the 3-card hands you play, this is known as a bus ride or a poppy, which scores an extra point. (It does not matter whether any of your hands actually win, as long as they include all of your four equal cards.) Usually there is also an extra payment, to be agreed in advance. When playing a fixed payment per game the extra payment could be the value of a game; when the payment is 2p per point difference, a bus ride could be worth 5p or 10p or 20p from each player, according to agreement.\nIf two or more players have bus rides, only the highest scores. For this purpose only, four fours are highest, then aces, kings, queens, etc. down to fives, threes, twos.\nSome play that in order to score or be paid for a bus ride, you must knock (or "chap") when you first receive your cards, to warn the other players that you have four of a kind before they select their 3-card hands.\nIn South Wales, some play that four of a kind (or the best four of a kind if there is more than one) wins all four points for the deal, and the cards are not played. Four fours win the game outright.\n\nPairs\nA player who is dealt six pairs can show them and demand a new deal by the same dealer. This is not compulsory - if you can make some runs you might prefer to play the hand, but if you choose to declare the pairs instead of playing, this has precedence over all other actions and payments. For example a declaration of pairs has priority over a four of a kind or a crash announcement.\nSome play that only five pairs are needed to demand a redeal.\n\nThirteen card run\nA player who has one card of each rank (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K) can choose to declare this instead of playing the hand and according to prior agreement it either wins the current game outright, or entitles the holder to a payment. The payment could be equal to the stake for the game, or equal to the value of 10 points, if payments to the winner of the game are according to difference in points. If a 13 card run is declared the hand is not played, and the deal passes to the next player.\n\nFurther Variations\n\nOptional shuffle\nSome play that the dealer may choose not to shuffle; in this case the dealer must alert the other players that the cards are not shuffled. Also, the player to dealer\'s right may choose not to cut. If there is no shuffle, players who remember the previous deal may be able to estimate how the cards are distributed in the new deal.\n\nYogi or Chas\nIn this version, in case of a tie for a point, the point is awarded to a fictional player known as Yogi (in Yorkshire) or Chas (in Lincolnshire). At the end of the game, anyone whose score is equal to or below Yogi/Chas\'s score has to pay the winner double. (This replaces the rule whereby a player with no points at all must pay double). If Yogi or Chas wins the game (having more points at the end than any of the real players), then everyone pays the cost of the game into a pool, which goes to the winner of the next game.\n\nResetting to zero\nIn this variation, if a player declares six pairs or a thirteen card run from ace to king, the scores of the other three players are reduced to zero, while the score of the declaring player stays as it is. The cards are then thrown in and the next dealer deals. \nA player who holds one of these hands might choose not to declare it but to play the cards instead. This will often be sensible if the other players have no points or very few points to lose - a thirteen card run can be played as four runs, some of which may be on the bounce, so it should bring in at least one point.\n\nNo pairs\nIn some places, a pair is not a valid hand. The lowest playable three-card hand is a flush.\n\nNine Card Brag\nNine Card Brag can be played by up to five people. Everyone pays a stake to the pool and nine cards are dealt to each player. \n\nIf anyone has four of a kind, they show it and the best four of a kind wins the pot. \nIf anyone has four pairs, they can show them and "save the game". No one wins the pot, each player contributes another stake to it, and the next player deals.\nWinning the pot with four of a kind has priority over saving the game with four pairs.\n\nIf no one declares four of a kind or four pairs, each player divides their nine cards into three three-card Brag hands, placing the highest of these face down to their left, the lowest to their right and the middle hand between them. The left hands are exposed first, beginning with the player to dealer\'s left. Whoever has the best left hand begins exposing the middle hands, and whoever has the best of these begins exposing the right hands. Hands are always exposed in turn, going clockwise around the table. If there is a tie for best hand in any of the three rounds, the player who was first to expose the best hand wins that hand and is first to expose the next hand.\nThe ranking of Brag hands is as listed below, except that most play that the highest prial or is a set of nines, second is a set of aces, and other prials follow in the natural order: kings, queens, jacks, 10s, 8s, 7s, 6s, 5s, 4s, 3s, 2s. Fours of a kind rank in the same order as prials.\nA set of three cards which are not a run, flush or pair can also be played as a hand, and if all players play this, the highest card wins (if two or more people have the same highest card, the second highest card is compared, and if these are also equal, the third card).\nTo win the pot, a player must win at least two hands of the three hands. If three players win one hand each, the game is "saved" - that is, the pot is carried over to the next deal, and each player must contribute a further stake to it.\nVariations of Nine-Card Brag\nMany play that the pot is only won if a single player wins or at least ties all three hands. In this version the order in which the hands are exposed is not significant. If the same players tie as winners of all three hands, or if no player is best or equal best in all three hands, no one wins and the pot is carried forward to the next deal, everyone adding another stake.\nSome play that a prial of threes or a prial of sevens, rather than nines, is highest.\nSome play that after looking at his hand, the dealer can decide to deal a tenth card to each player. Each player must then discard one card and the play proceeds as usual. This gives the dealer a slight advantage, in that the other players have no say over whether the tenth card is dealt.\nSome play that if you consider you have no chance of winning you can call a "bum deal" and "pack" (i.e. throw in) your cards - this has no real effect on the game - the others play as usual, and you are entitled to play your cards rather than packing, however bad they are.\nSome play that four pairs have priority over four of a kind.\nSome play that a nine card running flush beats four of a kind. \nVictor Wakefield reports a version in which two jokers are added to the pack, allowing six people to play. A joker can be used to represent a specific rank or a specific suit - so it can be used to make a prial or a run or a flush, but not a running flush. Between two otherwise equal hands, one made of natural cards beats one containing a joker. When used in a flush, the joker always counts as the lowest card of its suit - so for example 7-4-joker beats 7-3-2, which in turn beats 7-3-joker.\nIn the six player game with two jokers, all the cards are dealt, but it is still possible to play the variant where the dealer can deal a tenth card as follows. If a player calls a "bum deal", then the dealer may shuffle that player\'s cards and deal one each to the remaining five players. These players each discard a card and the discards along with the undealt cards of the bum deal hand can be taken by the player who called the bum deal and played as a hand.\nSome play that jokers are exactly equivalent to the card they substitute for - wild cards are not inferior to natural ones. So 10-9-8 and 10-joker-8 are equal hands the first exposed would win. Nevertheless, in this version, jokers cannot be used to claim the pot by making four of a kind - only a natural four of a kind wins outright.\nSome play that declaring four pairs has priority over declaring four of a kind.\nNine-Card Brag is sometimes played for points, rather than with a pot for each deal. In that case the points scored in each deal are as follows:\n\n3 points for 4 of a kind, or\n1 point for saving the game (4 pair), or\n4 points for winning all three 3-card hands, or\n1 point for each 3-card hand won (if no one wins all three)\n\nA target number of points is set, and the player who first reaches or passes the target wins the pot. Alternatively a time limit can be set after which a fixed number of deals is played, for example "last 4 deals" could be called at 7.30 pm.  \n  In this game a player cannot win the pot by saving the game. If a player achieves the highest score by saving the game in the last deal, another deal must be played.\n  \n\nIn the point scoring version with a target score, some play that a player who has four of a kind can choose to peg six points or to set all the other players back six points.\nSix Card Brag\nEveryone contributes an agreed stake to the pot, and the dealer deals out 6 cards to each player, one at a time. If anyone has four cards of the same rank they declare this immediately and the best four of a kind wins.\nIf no one has four of a kind, each player divides their six cards into two three-card Brag hands, placing them face-down on the table with the higher on the left and the lower on the right. The player to dealer\'s left begins by exposing his left hand. The other players in turn either pass or expose their left hands. Whoever has the best left hand (or the first of these if there is a tie) then exposes his right hand. The other players in turn do the same or pass.\nThe ranking of Brag hands is as listed below, except that most play that the highest prial or is a set of sixes, second is a set of aces, and other prials follow in the natural order: kings, queens, jacks, 10s, 9s, 8s, 7s, 5s, 4s, 3s, 2s. Fours of a kind rank in the same order.\nA set of three cards which are not a run, flush or pair can also be played as a hand, and if all players play this, the highest card wins (if two or more people have the same highest card, the second highest card is compared, and if these are also equal, the third card).\nIf one player has the highest left hand and the highest right hand, or wins one of these and ties the other, or ties for best with both hands, that player wins the pot. If the same two players tie for best left hand and for best right hand then they split the pot equally between them. In any other case, no one wins, and the pot is carried forward to the next deal, everyone adding another stake.\nVariation: some play that a six-card running flush - for example 3-4-5-6-7-8-9 of one suit - wins the hand, beating four of a kind.\nSeven Card Brag\nThis game is the same as Six Card Brag, except for the following.\n\nSeven cards are dealt to each player.\nIf no one has four of a kind, each player discards one card face down before dividing the remaining six into a left hand and a right hand.\nThe highest prial or four of a kind is a set of sevens, others ranking in their natural order - so the order of precedence for prials and fours of a kind is 7-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-6-5-4-3-2.\nSome play that a seven card running flush beats four of a kind. \n\n\n\nRank of Brag hands\nThe order of the possible three-card Brag hands, from highest to lowest, is as follows.\n\nCombinationExamplesExplanation\nPrial3-3-3A-A-A. . .2-2-2"Prial" - short for "pair royal" - is the name in Brag for a set of three cards of equal rank. The best is usually a prial of threes, though in some variations some other prial is best (this will be specified in the rules for the relevant game). The remaining prials follow in the rank order of the cards: A-A-A, K-K-K, Q-Q-Q, etc. down to 2-2-2, three twos being the lowest prial.\nRunning flushorRun on the bounce3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2A running flush is a set of three consecutive cards of the same suit. A run is a set of three consecutive cards of mixed suits. Although the ace is high, A-2-3 counts as a valid run - or a valid running flush if all the cards are the same suit. In fact A-2-3 is the highest run or running flush, A-K-Q of a suit is the second highest, then K-Q-J, and so on down to 4-3-2, which is the lowest. 2-A-K is not a valid run or running flush.\nAny running flush beats any run with mixed suits - so for example 4-3-2 beats 3-2-A or A-K-Q. \nRun3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2\nFlushA-K-J. . .5-3-2A flush consists of three cards of the same suit - not all consecutive, or it would be a running flush. When comparing flushes, the highest card is compared first, then if these are equal the middle card, and finally if necessary the lowest. Therefore K-9-2 beats Q-10-5, which beats Q-10-3, which beats Q-9-8.\nPairA-A-K. . .2-2-3A pair consists of two cards of equal rank. The third card is of a different rank, otherwise you would have a prial. When comparing pairs, the rank of the pair is compared first, and if these are equal the odd card determines which is higher. So for example 9-9-3 beats 8-8-K, which beats 8-8-J.\n\nThe above are the only 3-card hands that are playable in Crash. In Three Card Brag, it is also possible to play three unmatched cards - cards that are not consecutive, not all of the same suit and contain no pair. These rank according to their highest card; if the highest cards of two hands are equal the second highest cards are compared, and if these are equal too then the third highest. So J-6-3 beats 10-9-7, which beats 10-9-6. An example of the highest unmatched set is A-K-J and of the lowest is 5-3-2. These unmatched sets can be used in 6-card, 7-card and 9-card Brag, but not in Crash.\nThere is no order of suits in Brag, so it is possible for two hands to be equal in rank - for example 7-7-Q is equal to 7-7-Q.\nPoker players should take care to note that a running flush (\'straight flush\') is beaten by a prial in this game, and that the \'run\' and \'flush\' in Brag rank in the opposite order to Poker.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Showdown games > Partition Games > Crash (13-card Brag)\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2000, 2001, 2003.

A point is scored by the winner of each three-card hand, and the first to an agreed target score wins the game. Unlike Three Card Brag, on which the hand patterns are based, Crash and the other games on this page are not high stake gambling games. They are usually played for a small amount of money, and there is no process of betting to raise the stake.\nCrash\nI am grateful to the many people who have contributed information about Crash, including: Bob Allison, David Calvert, Matt Daligan, Ben Hall, David Jennings, Robert Jones, Stephen Lowry, Allister Paterson, Peter Rollinson, Tom Valentine and Stephen Williams.\nThe game of Crash is also known as Thirteen Card Brag. It is played over a large part of the north of England and in Wales - I have reports ranging from Coventry and Burton-on-Trent in the south to Cumbria and Yorkshire in the north, from Welshpool and from South Wales; also one report from Plymouth and one from Edinburgh, where the game was known as Crackers. There are numerous variations in the rules. I will try to list all those I have collected, and would be interested in comments and in further reports of places where Crash is played and the versions in use.\nPlayers, cards and deal\nCrash is essentially a four player game. It is played with a standard 52 card pack.\nThe first dealer is chosen at random. One method is to deal the cards around face up: the first player who receives a seven is the first dealer. The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer\'s right cuts, and the dealer deals out all the cards clockwise, one at a time, so that everyone has 13 cards. After the cards have been played and scored, the turn to deal passes to the left.\nIt is possible for three people to play. In this case four 13-card hands are still dealt: three to the players and one face-down spare hand. Starting with the player to dealer\'s left, each player in turn then has the option to discard their hand and take the spare hand in exchange (without first knowing what the spare hand contains). Some play that anyone exchanging for the spare hand must put an additional stake in the pool which will be taken by the eventual winner of the game.\nIf two people wish to play, there will be two spare hands, and each player may keep the hand they are dealt or exchange it sight unseen for one of the spares.\nThe Play\nEach player divides their 13 cards into up to four three-card Brag hands, which are placed face down in front of the player in descending order from left to right. The card or cards remaining are set aside.\nThe valid three-card hands in descending order are:\n\nPrial: three cards of the same rank - threes highest, then aces, kings, etc.\nRunning Flush, also known as a \'run on the bounce\' or a trotter: three consecutive cards in one suit - 3-2-A highest, then A-K-Q, down to 4-3-2 (lowest)\nRun: three consecutive cards of mixed suits - ranking as for running flushes.\nFlush: three cards of the same suit (ace high)\nPair: two cards of the same rank with any third card (aces high)\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Brag hands, these combinations are explained in more detail at the end of this page.\nNote that three unrelated cards - all different ranks, mixed suits and not consecutive - do not form a valid hand. Normally you arrange your 13 cards into four 3-card hands and discard the last card, but in some cases you be unable or unwilling to make as many as four valid hands from your 13 cards. In that case you just make as many hands as you wish - perhaps only two or three - and discard your remaining cards.\nWhen all are ready, everyone reveals their leftmost 3-card hand (highest hand), and the best of these hands scores a point. Then everyone reveals their second hand and the best of the second hands again scores a point, then the same again for the third hands and the fourth hands.\nIt can happen that there is a tie for best hand - for example two players have equally high runs with different suits. This is called a stick-up or a stopper, and no one scores the corresponding point.\nYou must always place your 3-card hands in descending order from left to right. Anyone who places a better hand to the right of a worse hand (so unfairly increasing their chance of winning one of the later points) automatically loses the game. Also, if you make fewer than four hands, the hands that you do make must always compete for the earliest points - for example the first three points if you made three hands.\nScoring\nDifferent target scores are used in different places - some play to 7 points; some to 10, 11, 13 or even 21. The target score may be increased if there are fewer than 4 players - for example 4 players play to 11 points, two or three play to 15. In South Wales, the game is played to 12 points, but the leader must be 2 points ahead of the second placed player to win; if not, play continues until someone achieves a 2-point lead.\n\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach the target. This may happen before all the hands have been compared. For example, in a 7-point game, if two players have 6, and one of them wins the first (left) hand of the next deal, that player has won the game by reaching 7 first, even if the second player had the best of the second, third and fourth hands.\nIn some places the score is kept on paper. Sometimes a special peg-board is used: illustrated to the right are two designs for the 7-point game from Salford and Coventry; players start from the corners and the winner is the first to reach the centre hole. Some score on a cribbage board, each player using one of the four tracks, starting from one end, the aim of course being to reach the agreed target score first.\nThe winner of the game is paid by the other three players. Some use a fixed payment per game - such as 50p; others play that each pays the winner an amount (for example 1p or 2p) for each point that they are short of the target. In either case, some play that anyone who scored no points at all during the game must pay double. Some play that if all three opponents of the winner scored zero points, the payment for game is trebled.\nThe Crash\nA crash occurs when one player wins all four points in a deal. This is rewarded with an extra score, which should be agreed on before playing, because it varies from place to place.\n\nSome play that a crash wins the current game outright.\nIn some places a crash is worth just one extra point - five points instead of the usual four.\nSome play that a crash wins four points towards the current game, and in addition the player who crashed is paid an extra stake (usually equal to the value of a game) by each opponent.\n\nSome play that a crash is only valid if the player announces it after everyone has set their hands, but before any cards are exposed. In this version of the game, a player who wins all four hands without having said \'crash\' just scores four points towards the current game. The player attempting crash should check that everyone is ready before announcing it; no rearrangement of hands is allowed after the announcement. Again, there are various ways of scoring:\n\nSome play that an announced crash wins the current game if successful. If a player announces crash but then fails to win all four hands, the player scores nothing for that deal.\nSome award an extra payment outside the game for a successful announced crash. If you announce crash and fail to win all four hands you have to pay the other players the amount you would have won. For example in a 10-point game where the winner is paid 2p per point difference, a player announcing a crash receives 20p from each opponent in addition to the 4 points if it succeeds; if it fails, the player scores points as usual for any hands won, but has to pay 20p to each opponent for the crash.\n\nIf a player reaches the target score before all four sets of hands have been compared, the game is over, and there can be no crash, even if the same player would have won the remaining hands. Therefore, in the version where you are paid extra for a successful announced crash, you should be careful not to announce it when you need 3 or fewer points to win: you would be certain to fail, as the game would end before you had won your four hands.\nSpecial hands\nThe following special hands are usually but not always recognised. The details should be agreed before playing.\n\nFour of a kind\nIf you have all four cards of one rank and include them all in the 3-card hands you play, this is known as a bus ride or a poppy, which scores an extra point. (It does not matter whether any of your hands actually win, as long as they include all of your four equal cards.) Usually there is also an extra payment, to be agreed in advance. When playing a fixed payment per game the extra payment could be the value of a game; when the payment is 2p per point difference, a bus ride could be worth 5p or 10p or 20p from each player, according to agreement.\nIf two or more players have bus rides, only the highest scores. For this purpose only, four fours are highest, then aces, kings, queens, etc. down to fives, threes, twos.\nSome play that in order to score or be paid for a bus ride, you must knock (or "chap") when you first receive your cards, to warn the other players that you have four of a kind before they select their 3-card hands.\nIn South Wales, some play that four of a kind (or the best four of a kind if there is more than one) wins all four points for the deal, and the cards are not played. Four fours win the game outright.\n\nPairs\nA player who is dealt six pairs can show them and demand a new deal by the same dealer. This is not compulsory - if you can make some runs you might prefer to play the hand, but if you choose to declare the pairs instead of playing, this has precedence over all other actions and payments. For example a declaration of pairs has priority over a four of a kind or a crash announcement.\nSome play that only five pairs are needed to demand a redeal.\n\nThirteen card run\nA player who has one card of each rank (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K) can choose to declare this instead of playing the hand and according to prior agreement it either wins the current game outright, or entitles the holder to a payment. The payment could be equal to the stake for the game, or equal to the value of 10 points, if payments to the winner of the game are according to difference in points. If a 13 card run is declared the hand is not played, and the deal passes to the next player.\n\nFurther Variations\n\nOptional shuffle\nSome play that the dealer may choose not to shuffle; in this case the dealer must alert the other players that the cards are not shuffled. Also, the player to dealer\'s right may choose not to cut. If there is no shuffle, players who remember the previous deal may be able to estimate how the cards are distributed in the new deal.\n\nYogi or Chas\nIn this version, in case of a tie for a point, the point is awarded to a fictional player known as Yogi (in Yorkshire) or Chas (in Lincolnshire). At the end of the game, anyone whose score is equal to or below Yogi/Chas\'s score has to pay the winner double. (This replaces the rule whereby a player with no points at all must pay double). If Yogi or Chas wins the game (having more points at the end than any of the real players), then everyone pays the cost of the game into a pool, which goes to the winner of the next game.\n\nResetting to zero\nIn this variation, if a player declares six pairs or a thirteen card run from ace to king, the scores of the other three players are reduced to zero, while the score of the declaring player stays as it is. The cards are then thrown in and the next dealer deals. \nA player who holds one of these hands might choose not to declare it but to play the cards instead. This will often be sensible if the other players have no points or very few points to lose - a thirteen card run can be played as four runs, some of which may be on the bounce, so it should bring in at least one point.\n\nNo pairs\nIn some places, a pair is not a valid hand. The lowest playable three-card hand is a flush.\n\nNine Card Brag\nNine Card Brag can be played by up to five people. Everyone pays a stake to the pool and nine cards are dealt to each player. \n\nIf anyone has four of a kind, they show it and the best four of a kind wins the pot. \nIf anyone has four pairs, they can show them and "save the game". No one wins the pot, each player contributes another stake to it, and the next player deals.\nWinning the pot with four of a kind has priority over saving the game with four pairs.\n\nIf no one declares four of a kind or four pairs, each player divides their nine cards into three three-card Brag hands, placing the highest of these face down to their left, the lowest to their right and the middle hand between them. The left hands are exposed first, beginning with the player to dealer\'s left. Whoever has the best left hand begins exposing the middle hands, and whoever has the best of these begins exposing the right hands. Hands are always exposed in turn, going clockwise around the table. If there is a tie for best hand in any of the three rounds, the player who was first to expose the best hand wins that hand and is first to expose the next hand.\nThe ranking of Brag hands is as listed below, except that most play that the highest prial or is a set of nines, second is a set of aces, and other prials follow in the natural order: kings, queens, jacks, 10s, 8s, 7s, 6s, 5s, 4s, 3s, 2s. Fours of a kind rank in the same order as prials.\nA set of three cards which are not a run, flush or pair can also be played as a hand, and if all players play this, the highest card wins (if two or more people have the same highest card, the second highest card is compared, and if these are also equal, the third card).\nTo win the pot, a player must win at least two hands of the three hands. If three players win one hand each, the game is "saved" - that is, the pot is carried over to the next deal, and each player must contribute a further stake to it.\nVariations of Nine-Card Brag\nMany play that the pot is only won if a single player wins or at least ties all three hands. In this version the order in which the hands are exposed is not significant. If the same players tie as winners of all three hands, or if no player is best or equal best in all three hands, no one wins and the pot is carried forward to the next deal, everyone adding another stake.\nSome play that a prial of threes or a prial of sevens, rather than nines, is highest.\nSome play that after looking at his hand, the dealer can decide to deal a tenth card to each player. Each player must then discard one card and the play proceeds as usual. This gives the dealer a slight advantage, in that the other players have no say over whether the tenth card is dealt.\nSome play that if you consider you have no chance of winning you can call a "bum deal" and "pack" (i.e. throw in) your cards - this has no real effect on the game - the others play as usual, and you are entitled to play your cards rather than packing, however bad they are.\nSome play that four pairs have priority over four of a kind.\nSome play that a nine card running flush beats four of a kind. \nVictor Wakefield reports a version in which two jokers are added to the pack, allowing six people to play. A joker can be used to represent a specific rank or a specific suit - so it can be used to make a prial or a run or a flush, but not a running flush. Between two otherwise equal hands, one made of natural cards beats one containing a joker. When used in a flush, the joker always counts as the lowest card of its suit - so for example 7-4-joker beats 7-3-2, which in turn beats 7-3-joker.\nIn the six player game with two jokers, all the cards are dealt, but it is still possible to play the variant where the dealer can deal a tenth card as follows. If a player calls a "bum deal", then the dealer may shuffle that player\'s cards and deal one each to the remaining five players. These players each discard a card and the discards along with the undealt cards of the bum deal hand can be taken by the player who called the bum deal and played as a hand.\nSome play that jokers are exactly equivalent to the card they substitute for - wild cards are not inferior to natural ones. So 10-9-8 and 10-joker-8 are equal hands the first exposed would win. Nevertheless, in this version, jokers cannot be used to claim the pot by making four of a kind - only a natural four of a kind wins outright.\nSome play that declaring four pairs has priority over declaring four of a kind.\nNine-Card Brag is sometimes played for points, rather than with a pot for each deal. In that case the points scored in each deal are as follows:\n\n3 points for 4 of a kind, or\n1 point for saving the game (4 pair), or\n4 points for winning all three 3-card hands, or\n1 point for each 3-card hand won (if no one wins all three)\n\nA target number of points is set, and the player who first reaches or passes the target wins the pot. Alternatively a time limit can be set after which a fixed number of deals is played, for example "last 4 deals" could be called at 7.30 pm.  \n  In this game a player cannot win the pot by saving the game. If a player achieves the highest score by saving the game in the last deal, another deal must be played.\n  \n\nIn the point scoring version with a target score, some play that a player who has four of a kind can choose to peg six points or to set all the other players back six points.\nSix Card Brag\nEveryone contributes an agreed stake to the pot, and the dealer deals out 6 cards to each player, one at a time. If anyone has four cards of the same rank they declare this immediately and the best four of a kind wins.\nIf no one has four of a kind, each player divides their six cards into two three-card Brag hands, placing them face-down on the table with the higher on the left and the lower on the right. The player to dealer\'s left begins by exposing his left hand. The other players in turn either pass or expose their left hands. Whoever has the best left hand (or the first of these if there is a tie) then exposes his right hand. The other players in turn do the same or pass.\nThe ranking of Brag hands is as listed below, except that most play that the highest prial or is a set of sixes, second is a set of aces, and other prials follow in the natural order: kings, queens, jacks, 10s, 9s, 8s, 7s, 5s, 4s, 3s, 2s. Fours of a kind rank in the same order.\nA set of three cards which are not a run, flush or pair can also be played as a hand, and if all players play this, the highest card wins (if two or more people have the same highest card, the second highest card is compared, and if these are also equal, the third card).\nIf one player has the highest left hand and the highest right hand, or wins one of these and ties the other, or ties for best with both hands, that player wins the pot. If the same two players tie for best left hand and for best right hand then they split the pot equally between them. In any other case, no one wins, and the pot is carried forward to the next deal, everyone adding another stake.\nVariation: some play that a six-card running flush - for example 3-4-5-6-7-8-9 of one suit - wins the hand, beating four of a kind.\nSeven Card Brag\nThis game is the same as Six Card Brag, except for the following.\n\nSeven cards are dealt to each player.\nIf no one has four of a kind, each player discards one card face down before dividing the remaining six into a left hand and a right hand.\nThe highest prial or four of a kind is a set of sevens, others ranking in their natural order - so the order of precedence for prials and fours of a kind is 7-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-6-5-4-3-2.\nSome play that a seven card running flush beats four of a kind. \n\n\n\nRank of Brag hands\nThe order of the possible three-card Brag hands, from highest to lowest, is as follows.\n\nCombinationExamplesExplanation\nPrial3-3-3A-A-A. . .2-2-2"Prial" - short for "pair royal" - is the name in Brag for a set of three cards of equal rank. The best is usually a prial of threes, though in some variations some other prial is best (this will be specified in the rules for the relevant game). The remaining prials follow in the rank order of the cards: A-A-A, K-K-K, Q-Q-Q, etc. down to 2-2-2, three twos being the lowest prial.\nRunning flushorRun on the bounce3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2A running flush is a set of three consecutive cards of the same suit. A run is a set of three consecutive cards of mixed suits. Although the ace is high, A-2-3 counts as a valid run - or a valid running flush if all the cards are the same suit. In fact A-2-3 is the highest run or running flush, A-K-Q of a suit is the second highest, then K-Q-J, and so on down to 4-3-2, which is the lowest. 2-A-K is not a valid run or running flush.\nAny running flush beats any run with mixed suits - so for example 4-3-2 beats 3-2-A or A-K-Q. \nRun3-2-AA-K-Q. . .4-3-2\nFlushA-K-J. . .5-3-2A flush consists of three cards of the same suit - not all consecutive, or it would be a running flush. When comparing flushes, the highest card is compared first, then if these are equal the middle card, and finally if necessary the lowest. Therefore K-9-2 beats Q-10-5, which beats Q-10-3, which beats Q-9-8.\nPairA-A-K. . .2-2-3A pair consists of two cards of equal rank. The third card is of a different rank, otherwise you would have a prial. When comparing pairs, the rank of the pair is compared first, and if these are equal the odd card determines which is higher. So for example 9-9-3 beats 8-8-K, which beats 8-8-J.\n\nThe above are the only 3-card hands that are playable in Crash. In Three Card Brag, it is also possible to play three unmatched cards - cards that are not consecutive, not all of the same suit and contain no pair. These rank according to their highest card; if the highest cards of two hands are equal the second highest cards are compared, and if these are equal too then the third highest. So J-6-3 beats 10-9-7, which beats 10-9-6. An example of the highest unmatched set is A-K-J and of the lowest is 5-3-2. These unmatched sets can be used in 6-card, 7-card and 9-card Brag, but not in Crash.\nThere is no order of suits in Brag, so it is possible for two hands to be equal in rank - for example 7-7-Q is equal to 7-7-Q.\nPoker players should take care to note that a running flush (\'straight flush\') is beaten by a prial in this game, and that the \'run\' and \'flush\' in Brag rank in the opposite order to Poker.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Showdown games > Partition Games > Crash (13-card Brag)\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 2000, 2001, 2003.

In the following centuries it spread to Central Europe, where it became extremely well known and developed many variations. These continued to be played with a special pack of cards whose designs were derived from the Venetian pattern. These packs had 36 cards, consisting of ace, king, knight, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 2 in the Italian suits of coins, cups, swords and batons. Forms of Trappola were especially popular in the Czech lands and survived there until the twentieth century, but since the second world war the special Trappola cards are no longer made and the game was thought to have died out. The reverse game Coteccio, played in Trieste, was its nearest known living relative. But now, thanks to the researches of Tom Svoboda of Prague, we know that Trappola is not dead. The game of Stovkahra, also known as Brko, which is played to this day in the village of umice in Romania, is a genuine Trappola game, perhaps the last of its kind.\n\numice is a village of about 500 inhabitants, situated in the Bant region of Romania, about 40 km north-west of Orsova (which is on the Danube, about 150 km east of Beograd). In the first half of the nineteenth century, this region was on the frontier of the Austro-Hungarian empire and Czechs and other citizens were given government incentives to settle there; they were granted land and freedom from taxes. In 1918 the region became part of Romania and most of the Czech settlers returned to their homeland, but nine Czech villages still exist there; umice is one of them. The people speak good archaic Czech and have little contact with their Romanian neighbours. Their isolation was ended in 1989 when contact with the Czech Republic was re-established and travel became possible. Now many of the younger people from these villages are moving to the Czech Republic, and it seems likely that the Czech villages in Romania will not survive for more than 15 years or so.\n\nTom Svoboda visited this region in summer 1997, and enquired about the card games played there. There are local versions of normal Czech games such as Ferbl, 21 and 66, but in umice they also play a form of Trappola. The game is called Stovkahra (meaning "hundred-game") by older people but among the younger players it is known as Brko (which means a matchstick or small piece of wood). It is played exclusively by men, and the whole male population of Sumice seems to know the game; they play fast, enthusiastically and loudly, banging the cards down on the table. Many of the players are farmers; in the winter months when they have little to do, and are sometimes cut off from the outside world for long periods by snow, they play cards every day. \n\nOf course, traditional Trappola cards are no longer generally available. Regular production ceased when the last packs were made in Prague in 1944, and probably they had been unobtainable in Romania long before this. The Romanian Czechs therefore adapted Stovkahra to be played with the German suited 32 card pack, but the point values of the cards and combinations remain unmistakably those of Trappola. Also, the characteristic bonuses of 26, 52 or 10 for winning the last trick, the first trick or an intermediate trick with the lowest card of a suit have been retained. These bonuses have been transferred from the twos of the Trappola pack to the sevens, which are the lowest cards in the German suited pack. Prague pattern cards are used when possible, but since these are also hard to obtain in Romania, the game has recently been played with Tell cards imported from Hungary. \n\nPlayers, cards and objective.\n\nStovkahra is a point-trick game, played with a German suited pack of 32 cards. There are 4 players in fixed partnerships, partners facing each other. Deal and play are clockwise. The rank of cards in each suit (from high to low) and their point values are: \n\nace......6 points\nking......5 points\nupper knave (svrek)......4 points\nlower knave (spodek)......3 points\nten......0 points\nnine......0 points\neight......0 points\nseven......0 points\n\nThe objective is to be the first team to score a total 100 or more points. Points are scored for combinations held in a player\'s hand, for cards taken in tricks and as bonuses for winning certain tricks. It will usually take several deals to reach 100 points.\n\nCombinations\n\nA player who holds three or four cards of the same rank (other than nines or eights) can declare them before the lead to the first trick. The scores for combinations are: \n\nfour aces......40 points\nthree aces......30 points\nfour tens or four sevens......20 points\nthree tens or three sevens......10 points\nfour kings, upper or lower knaves......12 points\nthree kings, upper or lower knaves......6 points\n \nIt is not compulsory to declare a combination, but only declared combinations are scored. When declaring, the rank and number of cards must be stated, but when declaring three of a kind it is not necessary to say which card is missing. There is no score for carte blanche or carta bianca (hands without picture cards, which scored points in earlier versions of Trappola).\n\nBonuses\n\nThe team which wins the last trick scores an extra 6 points. For winning a trick other than the first or the last with a seven there is a bonus of 10 points. A team which wins the last trick with a seven scores a bonus of 26 points (which includes the normal 6 for winning the last trick). A team which wins the first trick with a seven scores a 52 point bonus. \n\nDealing, trumps\n\nThe cards are shuffled only before the first deal of a game; for subsequent deals the cards are simply gathered together and cut by the player to the dealer\'s right. After the cut, the bottom card of the pack is shown to everyone and its suit is trumps. The cards are dealt out in packets of three to each player, then two, then three, so that everyone has eight cards. The first three cards are dealt face up to the player to dealer\'s left; the rest of the cards are dealt face down as usual. Exposing this player\'s first three cards is meant to compensate for the advantage that the non-dealer\'s team have in playing first.\n\nPlay\n\nAfter everyone has declared any combinations they wish to, the player to dealer\'s left leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can, and anyone who cannot follow suit must play a trump. Subject to these constraints, players are obliged to beat the highest card so far played to the trick if they can. The trick is won by the highest trump in it, or, if it contains no trump, by the highest card played of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\n\nScoring\n\nThe first team to reach 100 points or more wins a game, for which they get one brko (matchstick) if the losers had 50 or more points, or two brka if the losers had less than 50 points. It is possible to reach 100 points in the middle of the play. If a player who has just declared a combination or won a trick thinks that his team has 100 or more points, he can announce "dost" (enough) instead of leading to the next trick. This stops the play and the card points are counted. If the team which said dost really do have enough points, they win one or two brka depending on whether the other team had more or less than 50. If they were mistaken, in that they actually have less than 100 points, the other team win two brka irrespective of their own points score. \n\nThe winners of each game always have the choice of increasing their own brka by the amount won (one or two) or reducing the other team\'s brka by the same amount. The overall winners of the series of games are the first team who collect ten or more brek.\n\nNotes\n\nIf a team reaches 100 points but forgets to say dost, they risk letting the other team win by reaching 100 and saying dost; a team which announces dost correctly wins even if the other team actually reached 100 points earlier without noticing.\n\nIn practice, the only way to win the first trick with a seven, scoring the bonus of 52, is to trump with the seven of trumps. It is an accepted part of the game that if the player to dealer\'s right has the seven of trumps and is void in another suit, that player will try to signal to the leader to play this suit, by mouthing the name of the suit when the opponents are not looking.\n\nAs a variation, it can be agreed that when a team reach 10 brek, the series of games is continued to see which team is the first to reach 20. If the first team to 10 also reach 20 first, they are the winners of two series of games; if the other team reaches 20 first the result is a draw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Trappola Group > Stovkahra\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1997.

This page was produced to fill the gap by explaining how Bridge is played. The explanation is intended for people who have some experience of cards and card games, but no knowledge of Bridge.\n\nIn the following years, several other sites with information of use to Bridge beginners appeared. Some of these appear among the links at the end of this page.\nBridge Baronsoftware top rated by the American Contract Bridge League\n\nTypes of Bridge\nRubber Bridge\n\nPlayers and Cards\nDeal\nBidding\nPlay\nScoring\n\nDuplicate Bridge\n\nBoards\nScoring\nTeams of Four\nPairs\nProcedure and Ethics\nStop and Alert\nUnauthorised Information\n\nDeception\n\nChicago\n\nChicago with Duplicate Scoring\nChicago with Russian Scoring\n\nThe Beer Card\nHoneymoon Bridge\nMinibridge\nBridge Resources on the Internet\nRules, advice and Bridge education\nDiscussion\nOnline Bridge\nBridge software\nLinks pages\nBridge Equipment Suppliers and other Bridge related pages\n\nTypes of Bridge\n\nContract Bridge was invented in the 1920\'s and in the following decades it was popularised especially in the USA by Ely Culbertson. Bridge currently occupies a position of great prestige, and is more comprehensively organised than any other card game. There are clubs, tournaments and championships throughout the world.\n\n\nRubber Bridge is the basic form of Contract Bridge, played by four players. Informal social Bridge games are often played this way, and Rubber Bridge is also played in clubs for money.\n\n\nDuplicate Bridge is the game normally played in clubs, tournaments and matches. The game is basically the same but the luck element is reduced by having the same deals replayed by different sets of players. At least eight players are required for this. There are some significant differences in the scoring. Two types of Duplicate Bridge will be covered:\n\nteams of four\npairs\n\n\nChicago is a version of Bridge played by four people over four deals.\n\nContract Bridge developed in the 1920\'s from Auction Bridge, which is different mainly in the scoring. In Auction Bridge, overtricks count towards making game, so it is only necessary to bid high enough to win the contract - there is no incentive to bid all the tricks you can make.\n\nBefore Auction Bridge there was Bridge-Whist or Straight Bridge (at the time this game was just called Bridge). Here is a link to the earliest published rules of Bridge, which appeared in 1886 under the name Biritch or Russian Whist. In Bridge-Whist there is no bidding at all - the dealer either names a trump suit or passes, in which case the dealer\'s partner must choose trumps. In either case the dealer\'s partner is dummy. Either opponent may double before the lead to the first trick, and if doubled, the dealer\'s side may redouble. In the earliest form of the game, after any redouble, the other side can redouble again, and this can continue indefinitely.\n\nThe duplicate format, in which the same cards are played at more than one table, has been in use since the 19th century for competitions in Auction Bridge, Straight Bridge, their ancestor Whist, and several other four-player card games, as well as for Contract Bridge from its invention to the present day.\n\nRubber Bridge\nPlayers and Cards\n\nThere are four players in two fixed partnerships. Partners sit facing each other. It is traditional to refer to the players according to their position at the table as North, East, South and West, so North and South are partners playing against East and West. The game is played clockwise.\n\nA standard 52 card pack is used. The cards in each suit rank from highest to lowest: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.\n\nDeal\n\nThe cards are shuffled by the player to dealer\'s left and cut by the player to dealer\'s right. The dealer deals out all the cards one at a time so that each player has 13. Turn to deal rotates clockwise.\n\nIt is traditional to use two packs of cards. During each deal, the dealer\'s partner shuffles the other pack and places it to the right. The dealer for the next hand then simply needs to pick up the cards from the left and pass them across to the right to be cut. Provided all the players understand and operate it, this procedure saves time and helps to remember whose turn it is to deal, as the spare pack of cards is always to the left of the next dealer.\n\nBidding\n\nThere is next an auction to decide who will be the declarer. A bid specifies a number of tricks and a trump suit (or that there will be no trumps). The side which bids highest will try to win at least that number of tricks bid, with the specified suit as trumps.\n\nWhen bidding, the number which is said actually represents the number of tricks in excess of six which the partnership undertakes to win. For example a bid of "two hearts" represents a contract to win at least 8 tricks (8 = 6 + 2) with hearts as trumps.\n\nFor the purpose of bidding the possible trump suits rank as follows: no trumps (highest), spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs (lowest). A bid of a larger number of tricks always beats a bid of a smaller number, and if the number of tricks bid are equal, the higher suit beats the lower. The lowest bid allowed is "one club" (to win at least 7 tricks with clubs as trumps), and the highest is "seven no trumps" (to win all 13 tricks without trumps). NB. In North America, the term for contracts played without a trump suit is "notrump" or "no trump" (without an \'s\').\n\nIt is also possible, during the auction, to "double" a bid by the other side or to "redouble" the opponents\' double. Doubling and redoubling essentially increase the score for the bid contract if won and the penalties if lost. If someone then bids higher, any previous doubles and redoubles are cancelled.\n\nNote that doubling does not affect the ranking of a bid - for example a bid of two spades is always higher than two hearts, even if the two hearts bid has been doubled or redoubled.\n\nThe dealer begins the auction, and the turn to speak passes clockwise. At each turn a player may either:\n\nmake a bid, which must be higher than the previous bid if any;\nsay "double", if the previous bid was by an opponent, and has not already been doubled;\nsay "redouble", if the previous bid was by one\'s own side and has been doubled by an opponent, but not yet redoubled;\n\npass, by saying "no bid" or "pass". This indicates that the player does not wish to bid, double or redouble at that turn, but a player who has passed is still allowed to bid, double or redouble at a later turn. NB. Either "no bid" or "pass" is permissible, but you should stick to one term or the other. "No bid" is usual in Britain; "pass" is usual in the USA.\n\nIf all four players pass on their first turn to speak the hand is said to be passed out. The cards are thrown in and the next dealer deals.\n\n  If anyone bids, then the auction continues until there are three passes in succession, and then stops. After three consecutive passes, the last bid becomes the contract. The team who made the final bid will now try to make the contract. The first player of this team who mentioned the denomination (suit or no trumps) of the contract becomes the declarer. The declarer\'s partner is known as the dummy.\n\nExample of an auction (North dealt):\n\n   North      East      South       West\n   pass      1 heart    double     3 hearts\n  3 spades    pass     4 spades     pass\n   pass       pass\nNorth-South will try to win at least 10 tricks with spades as trumps; North, who mentioned spades first, is the declarer. South\'s double of one heart was cancelled by West\'s bid of 3 hearts. \nThe Play\n\nThe player to the left of the declarer leads to the first trick and may play any card. Immediately after this opening lead, the dummy\'s cards are exposed. The dummy should arrange them neatly in suits, the cards of each suit arranged in rank order in an overlapping column, pointing towards the declarer, so that all the cards are clearly visible. The trump suit if any should be to dummy\'s right (declarer\'s left); in the diagram, spades are trump.\n\nPlay proceeds clockwise. Each of the other three players in turn must if possible play a card of the same suit that the leader played. A player with no card of the suit led may play any card. A trick consists of four cards, one from each player, and is won by the highest trump in it, or if no trumps were played by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next, and may lead any card.\n\nEach trick is gathered together and turned face down when complete, but you may ask to see the cards and ask who played which card until you or your partner has played to the next trick.  The tricks won are to be arranged neatly in front of one member of the winning side, so that they can easily be counted.\n\nDummy takes no active part in the play of the hand. Whenever it is dummy\'s turn to play, the declarer must say which of dummy\'s cards is to be played, and dummy plays the card as instructed (provided that it is legal). Dummy is not permitted to offer any advice or comment on the play. When dummy wins a trick, the declarer specifies which card dummy should lead to the next trick. If when calling for a card the declarer specifies the suit only, dummy is to play the lowest card of that suit.\n\nIt is also legal, and not unusual, for the declarer to play dummy\'s cards by physically taking them from dummy\'s hand rather than just calling for them. This allows the dummy player to leave the table during the play of the hand.\n\nScoring\n\nAs its name suggests, Rubber Bridge is played in rubbers. A rubber is the best of three games. A game is won by the first team to score 100 or more points for successful contracts, over several deals if necessary.\n\nA side which has already won one game towards the current rubber is said to be vulnerable. A side which has not yet won a game is not vulnerable. A side which is vulnerable is subject to higher bonuses and penalties than one that is not.\n\nThe score is kept on a piece of paper divided into two columns headed WE and THEY, for the two teams, with a horizontal line part-way down (see example). Scores for successful contracts are entered below the line, and count towards winning a game. Other scores, such as bonuses for tricks made in excess of the contract (overtricks), or penalties for tricks short of the contract (undertricks) are entered above the line, and do not count towards winning the game.\n\nScore for making the contract\n\nFor a successful contract, the score below the line for each trick (in excess of 6) bid and made is as follows:\n\nIf trumps are Clubs or Diamonds,   20 per trick\nIf trumps are Hearts or Spades,   30 per trick\nIf there are No Trumps, 40 for the first trick, and 30 for each subsequent trick.\n\nIf the contract was doubled the above scores are doubled. If it was doubled and redoubled, they are multiplied by 4. \n\n  In addition, the declarer\'s side scores an extra 50 points above the line if they succeed in a doubled contract. This is sometimes known as "50 for the insult". For making a redoubled contract the bonus is 100 above the line.\n\nBecause of the difference in score, clubs and diamonds are called the minor suits and hearts and spades are the major suits.\n\nSlam bonus\n\nA contract to make 12 tricks is known as a small slam. A contract to make all 13 tricks is called a grand slam. For bidding and making a slam, declarer\'s side get an extra bonus above the line, depending on their vulnerability, as follows:\n\n  Slam bonus         small slam       grand slam\n  not vulnerable        500              1000\n  vulnerable            750              1500\nScore for overtricks\n\nIf the declarer\'s side wins more tricks than were bid, and were not doubled, then in addition to the score below the line for the contract, they score for the overtricks above the line at the same rate as for bid tricks - i.e. 20 per trick if a minor suit was trumps; 30 per trick in a major suit or no trumps.\n\nIf the contract was doubled or redoubled, the bonus for overtricks does not depend on the trump suit, but does depend on whether the declarer\'s side was vulnerable as follows:\n  Score per overtrick    doubled    redoubled\n  not vulnerable           100         200\n  vulnerable               200         400\nPenalty for undertricks\n\nIf the declarer\'s side win fewer tricks than they bid, neither side scores anything below the line, but the declarer\'s opponents score above the line. This score depends on the declarer\'s side\'s vulnerability, and whether the contract was doubled or redoubled, as follows:\n  Undertrick penalty:            not vulnerable    vulnerable\n\n  Not doubled - each undertrick:       50             100\n\n  Doubled - first undertrick:         100             200\n  Doubled - 2nd and 3rd undertrick:   200 each        300 each\n  Doubled - subsequent undertricks:   300 each        300 each\nRedoubled undertricks cost twice as much as doubled undertricks.\nHonours\n\nThe top five trumps (A K Q J 10) are called honours. If one player holds all five of these cards, that player\'s side scores a bonus of 150 above the line. Four honours in one hand score 100. If there are no trumps, and a player holds four aces, that player\'s side scores 150 for honours.\n\nScores for honours are to be claimed at the end of the play (it is assumed that the players will remember what they held).\n\nAs there is no skill in scoring for honours, players often agree to play without the honour bonuses.\n\nGame and Rubber\n\nA side that accumulates 100 points or more below the line has won a game. A new line is drawn under the scores. Anything the opponents had below the line does not count towards the next game - they start from zero again.\n\nIt is important to notice that, starting from zero and in the absence of doubles, to make a game in one hand you need to succeed in a contract of at least three no trumps, four spades, four hearts, five clubs or five diamonds.\n\nThe side which first wins two games wins the rubber. For this they get a bonus of 700 if they won it two games to zero, or 500 if it was two games to one. Both sides\' scores are then totalled and if the game is being played for money, the side with the higher score wins an amount proportional to the difference in scores from the side with the lower score.\n\nIf play ends for any reason with a rubber unfinished, then a side with a game gets a bonus of 300 points, and a side with a part score (i.e. a score below the line towards an uncompleted game) gets a bonus of 100.\n\nExample of Rubber Bridge scoring\n\nThe scoresheet of a completed rubber might look like the example below. (The letters in brackets indicate successive deals as described in the corresponding footnotes - they would not appear on the scoresheet.)\n\n      WE       |    THEY\n               |\n     500 (f)   |\n      50 (f)   |\n     100 (f)   |\n     200 (e)   |    500 (i)\n     300 (b)   |     30 (g)\n      60 (a)   |     30 (c)\n  =============|==============    <-- the line\n      60 (a)   |    100 (c)\n  -------------|--------------    (c)\n     360 (f)   |     90 (d)\n  -------------|--------------    (f)\n      60 (h)   |     40 (g)\n               |     90 (i)\n(a) we bid 2 hearts and made 10 tricks - 60 below the line for the contract and 60 above for the overtricks\n  (b) they bid 4 spades, we doubled them, and they took only 8 tricks - we score 100 for their first undertrick and 200 for the second\n  (c) they bid 3 no trumps and made 10 tricks. This gives them a game (100 below the line) plus 30 above the line for their overtrick. A new line is ruled below the scores to indicate the start of a new game.\n  (d) they bid and made 3 spades\n  (e) they bid two diamonds and made 6 tricks - they are now vulnerable so we score 100 for each undertrick.\n  (f) we bid 6 hearts; they doubled us, but we won all 13 tricks. We score 360 (180 x 2) below the line for our doubled contract, giving us a game; 100 above for our doubled non-vulnerable overtrick; 50 above for making a doubled contract; and 500 bonus for a small slam bid and made.\n  (g) they bid one no trump and took 8 tricks; note that their 90 on deal (d) was part of the previous game, so the 40 below does not give them a game.\n  (h) we bid 3 clubs and made exactly 9 tricks.\n  (i) they bid 3 hearts and took exactly 9 tricks giving their second game and the rubber, for a bonus of 500 (two games to one).\nAdding up the scores, we have 1690 and they have 880. Therefore we have won by 810 points (even though they won the rubber). \nIn this example the "above the line" scores were entered starting immediately above the line and working upwards. This is traditional, at least in Britain, but not necessary - you can start at the top, just below the WE-THEY headings, and work downwards if you prefer.\nJohn Paton has produced a slide show version of the above example - it is available as an Open Office presentation and as a Powerpoint presentation.\n* Note on changes in scoring\n\nSome details of Bridge scoring were changed in 1987 for Duplicate Bridge and in 1993 for Rubber Bridge. Before the changes, the penalty for doubled undertricks when not vulnerable was 100 for the first and 200 each for all others (and twice as much for a redoubled contract). Also the bonus for making a redoubled contract was 50, not 100, and the bonus for a part score in an uncompleted rubber was 50, not 100.\n\nPartnership agreement and conventions\n\nAs in most card games, partners are forbidden to convey information to each other by talking, gestures, facial expression, etc. However there is considerable scope for partners to exchange information within the rules of the game by their choice of bids or cards played.\n\nThe bidding mechanism is such that if a player makes a bid (or double or redouble), it is always possible for the player\'s partner at their next turn to override that bid with a higher bid. This makes it possible for partners to assign arbitrary meanings to bids. Bids which can be taken at face value - that is they convey a genuine wish to play a contract to take the relevant number of tricks or more with the trump suit stated - are called natural. Bids which carry an agreed meaning other than this are called artificial or conventional.\n\nFor example if we are partners, we might agree that a bid of one club by me shows a strong hand, but has nothing to do with wanting clubs as trumps. Provided that we both understand this, you will not leave me to play a contract of one club, but will make some other bid, natural or artificial. Another example: since doubling a low-level suit contract in the hope of a penalty is unlikely to be profitable, almost all players use an agreement that in certain situations a double simply shows a good hand (perhaps with additional specifications) and asks partner to bid - this is known as a takeout double.\n\n\nA bidding system is a comprehensive set of partnership agreements about the meanings of bids.  For natural bids, players commonly have agreements on the number of cards held in a bid suit: for example in some natural systems, opening the bidding with one of a major suit implies a holding of at least five cards, while others require only four or more cards in the suit. Agreements also often relate to high cards held in the bid suit or in the hand generally. The overall strength of a hand is often measured in "high-card points", counting each ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, and 0 for other cards - an approach originally developed by and named after Milton Work in the 1920\'s.\nMost bidding systems also include some      agreements that in certain circumstances a player will not pass. A bid, natural or artificial, which by agreement requires the player\'s partner to respond with a bid, rather than pass and allow the contract to be played, is called a  forcing bid.  Sometimes the agreement is that after a certain bid both partners agree to keep the auction going until it reaches a certain level. For example a bid that by  agreement requires the partnership  to continue    bidding until a game contract is reached is known as a game-forcing bid.    Such methods help ensure that with suitable cards partners will have more than one opportunity to bid. These extra bids can be used to exchange further infomation about their hands and improve their chances of reaching the best contract.\n\n  The main restriction on agreements between partners about the meaning of bids is that all such agreements must be declared to the opponents. Players should declare their system (if any) at the start of a session. Many clubs and tournaments require that this be done by means of a convention card which sets out the meanings of bids. In addition, an player may, at their turn to bid or play, ask for and be given an explanation of the opponents\' bidding agreements. The explanation should be given by the partner of the player who made the bid in question. For example, if I double a suit contract, either opponent may, at their turn, ask my partner what the double means, and my partner must answer according to any agreement we may have about the meaning of the double - for example that it is for takeout or for penalties. If we have no agreement on this, partner should say so - players are not required or permitted to speculate or to guess at the meanings of bids in answer to such a question.\nIt is sometimes agreed that after the auction, the declarer\'s left hand opponent, having asked any necessary questions about the declarer\'s side\'s bidding agreements, leads the first card face down. The other opponent may then ask questions about the declarer\'s side\'s bidding, after which dummy\'s cards are exposed and play continues as usual. This procedure minimises the risk that by asking a question you may give unauthorised information to your partner. Asking at other times during the bidding or play, though legal and sometimes necessary, might be taken to imply that your next bid or play will depend on the answer given.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to the play. Partners may agree on the meaning of the choice of card played in certain circumstances. For example we may agree that when leading from a sequence of adjacent high cards such as K-Q-J we always lead the highest. Again, the opponents are entitled to know about such agreements. They should be declared on the convention card, and may be asked about during the play.\n\n\nIn Rubber Bridge one does not often come across complicated systems and partnership agreements. One is often playing with an unfamiliar partner, or in an informal setting. Complicated agreements are more often encountered in Duplicate Bridge, where the players are often long standing partners who have devoted considerable effort to agreeing their system.\nDuplicate Bridge\nIn Rubber Bridge, although the better players have a noticable edge and will undoubtedly win in the long run, the outcome of a single rubber depends heavily on which side is dealt the better cards. The idea of Duplicate Bridge is to eliminate this element of luck, by having the same hands played more than once, by different sets of players.\n\n\nSuppose we are partners and play a hand of Duplicate Bridge as North-South. Instead of being rewarded for our absolute score on that hand, our score is compared with those of other players who played the same deal as North-South against other opponents. We win if we score better than other players managed with our cards, and lose if we score worse.\n\nFor this comparison to be fair, it is necessary that each group of players who play the same deal should start from the same position. Therefore it is not practicable to play rubbers, where the scores carried forward from deal to deal affect the tactical situation. Instead, each deal is scored in its own right, and does not affect the scores for subsequent ones.  The concept of vulnerability is retained, but on each deal the vulnerability is preassigned.\nBoards\n\nAn almost essential piece of apparatus for playing Duplicate Bridge is a set of duplicate boards, and a pack of cards for each board. Each board contains four pockets marked North, East, South and West in which the cards for the four players are stored. Each board also carries a number to identify it, and has marks showing which of the players is dealer and whether each team is vulnerable or not. The  marking of the boards is as follows:\n\nBoard 1: dealer North; neither side vulnerable\nBoard 2: dealer East; North-South vulnerable\nBoard 3: dealer South; East-West vulnerable\nBoard 4: dealer West; both sides vulnerable\nBoard 5: dealer North; North-South vulnerable\nBoard 6: dealer East; East-West vulnerable\nBoard 7: dealer South; both sides vulnerable\nBoard 8: dealer West; neither side vulnerable\nBoard 9: dealer North; East-West vulnerable\nBoard 10: dealer East; both sides vulnerable\nBoard 11: dealer South; neither side vulnerable\nBoard 12: dealer West; North-South vulnerable\nBoard 13: dealer North; both sides vulnerable\nBoard 14: dealer East; neither side vulnerable\nBoard 15: dealer South; North-South vulnerable\nBoard 16: dealer West; East-West vulnerable\n\nAfter board 16 the pattern repeats - board 17 is like board 1, board 18 like board 2 and so on. \n\n  Before the boards are played the cards are shuffled, dealt and placed in the pockets. Traditionally, this was done by a neutral person or by a player in the presence at least one opponent. Nowadays  the cards are often dealt by computer, with the aim of ensuring perfect randomness while enabling a record of each deal to be kept. A simple method is for  the computer to produce a printed  hand record or a set of curtain cards,  specifying which cards should be in each hand on each board; a neutral person then has to construct the hands and put them in the pockets. Since the early 21st century, however, computer controlled dealing machines have become widely available. These machines physically sort  the playing cards and place them in the boards ready to be played. Early models did this with the aid of a bar code printed on each card; these are gradually being superseded by machines that  use optical character recognition (OCR) to identify and deal standard playing-cards.\n\nWhen about to play a board, the players take their cards from the appropriate pockets, check to see that they have 13 each, and then bid as usual. The mark on the board showing the \'dealer\' in practice just indicates which player is to begin the bidding. The opening lead is always made face down, as explained above, to give the leader\'s partner an opportunity to ask questions about the bidding before the led card is shown. During the play, the cards are not played in the centre of the table but in front of the players. At the end of each trick, all four players turn their played card face down. The cards played by each player are overlapped, with the longer axis of the card pointing to the winners of the trick (i.e. the cards belonging to tricks you have won are placed upright from your point of view, and the ones belonging to lost tricks sideways). That way you can easily see how many tricks you have won. Also, if the cards are kept in order, any dispute about revokes or tricks won or lost can be settled by reconstructing the play. At the end of the play, each player\'s cards are gathered up and replaced in the correct pocket, ready for the next time the board is to be played.\n\nWhen this method of play is used, dummy is expected to remain at the table if at all possible, and declarer then always calls dummy\'s cards rather than pulling them from the dummy. You may ask to look at the cards played to a trick by the other players as long as your own card is face up. Once you have turned your card face down, you no longer have the right to see any of the other cards played to that trick. (Unless you are dummy, you are still allowed to peek at your own played card, without exposing it, until the lead is made to the next trick.)\n\nScoring\n\nEach board is marked to show whether both sides, one side or neither side is vulnerable for that board. You still need to score at least 100 points for tricks bid and made to make a game, but on each board, both sides start with zero points towards games - there are no \'part scores\' carried forward.\n\nIn place of the rubber bonus, there are game and part score bonuses:\n  Making a game when vulnerable:       500 points\n  Making a game when not vulnerable:   300 points\n  Making a part score any time:         50 points\nThe rest of the scores are the same as in Rubber Bridge, except that there are no bonuses for honours in Duplicate Bridge. So for example: \n\nif we bid 2 spades and make 4 (10 tricks) we score 170, that is 60 for two spades bid and made, 60 for two overtricks and 50 for the part score;\nif we bid 4 spades and make it when we are not vulnerable we score 420 (120 for the contract and 300 for the game);\nif we bid 4 spades and make it when we are vulnerable we score 620 (120 for the contract plus 500 for the game).\n\nThese scores are of course not yet the final scores. They have yet to be compared with the scores achieved by other people who have played the same cards as us on this board. The method of doing this comparison varies according to what kind of duplicate is being played. Perhaps the commonest types are teams of four with international matchpoint (IMP) scoring, and matchpointed pairs.\nTeams of Four\n\nA match can be played between two teams of four - eight players in all. Each team consists of two partnerships, and you need two tables - preferably in separate rooms so that players cannot overhear events at the other table. Before starting the players agree how many boards will be played - this could be 24, 32, 48 or more, depending on the seriousness of the match and the time available. A 24 board match should easily be completed within three hours. Shorter matches, sometimes of as few as 6 boards, are commonly played if the match is part of a larger tournament. Longer matches are normally split into two or more segments (or stanzas) after each of which there may be a break and an opportunity to change seats.\n\n\nCall the tables 1 and 2 and the teams A and B. Then the pairs of team A sit North-South at table 1 and East-West at table 2, and the pairs of team B occupy the other seats. Take a convenient number of boards - say boards 1 to 12 - and give the first 6 to table 1 and the other 6 to table 2. As each table finishes their 6 boards they are passed to the other table to be replayed. Since none of the players should go near the other table before everyone has played all 12 boards, it is best if the boards are transferred from table to table by a neutral referee; if none is available, the boards that have been played once can be left in a place away from both tables for collection by the players from the other table. When all 12 boards have been played at both tables, it is a convenient time to  compare scores and maybe enjoy some refreshments.\n\n\nIt may be agreed that for the next segment, the two pairs of one of the teams should swap places. This gives each pair the opportunity to play against both pairs of the opposing team. The procedure about the number of segments in a match and the choice of seats for each segment may be laid down by the organiser of the event - otherwise it needs to be agreed between the team captains.\n\nEach player should have a score card to record the score on each board. The card has a row for each board. The beginning of North\'s card from table 1, when completed, might look like this:\n\n   Board       Final                      Score           IMPs\n Deal # Vul    Contract   By   Tricks   Plus   Minus    Plus   Minus\n\n  N   1  -       4S       S      10      420\n  E   2  NS      5D*      W       8      500\n  S   3  EW      3NT      W      12             690\n  W   4  All     2H       N       9      140                        \nIn the contract column 5D* means 5 diamonds doubled. The \'By\' column shows who was declarer. The score is recorded from player\'s point of view (North\'s in the example) - so when West goes down in 5 diamonds it is positive. The IMPs can only be filled in when this card is compared with one of the cards from the other room. Some players prefer to enter the number of over- or undertricks in the "Tricks" column rather than the total number of tricks taken. In that case the "Tricks" column entries for the four boards in the above example would read "=, -3, +3, +1". Suppose that our team mate East on table 2 has a card like this:\n   Board       Final                      Score           IMPs\n Deal # Vul    Contract   By   Tricks   Plus   Minus    Plus   Minus\n\n  N   1  -       4S       S      11             450\n  E   2  NS      4H       N      10             620\n  S   3  EW      6NT      W      12     1440\n  W   4  All     4H       N       9      100                        \nNow the differences can be converted to IMPs for the team. The following standard table is used: \n Point difference    IMPs\n\n      0 -   10         0\n     20 -   40         1\n     50 -   80         2\n     90 -  120         3\n    130 -  160         4\n    170 -  210         5\n    220 -  260         6\n    270 -  310         7\n    320 -  360         8\n    370 -  420         9\n    430 -  490        10\n    500 -  590        11\n    600 -  740        12\n    750 -  890        13\n    900 - 1090        14\n   1100 - 1290        15\n   1300 - 1490        16\n   1500 - 1740        17\n   1750 - 1990        18\n   2000 - 2240        19\n   2250 - 2490        20\n   2500 - 2990        21\n   3000 - 3490        22\n   3500 - 3990        23\n   4000 or more       24\nSo in the example, on the first board the difference between the two tables was 30 against us, and we lose 1 IMP. On the second board we lose 3 IMPs. Although on table 1 our North-South pair defeated West\'s 5 diamonds, on table 2 with the same cards our East-West pair allowed North to play and make 4 hearts. On board 3, where we bid the small slam on table 2, while they stopped in game on table 1, we gain 13 IMPs for a 750 point difference. On board 4 both Norths made 9 tricks in hearts, but we gain 6 IMPs because our North-South pair just bid 2 hearts rather than 4. Overall we are 15 IMPs ahead on those four boards. \n\n  After each scoring interval, the captains of the teams should check that the scores agree. The purpose of every player keeping score is to make it easier for errors to be traced and corrected.\n\nAt the end of the match, the result is the difference in IMPs between the teams. Sometimes there is then a further conversion of this margin into a match result, in which some fixed number of victory points is apportioned between the teams. There is no single standard conversion table, but here is an example table for a 24 board match:\n\n\n IMP difference    Victory Points\n\n    0 -  2            10 - 10\n    3 -  6            11 -  9\n    7 - 11            12 -  8\n   12 - 16            13 -  7\n   17 - 21            14 -  6\n   22 - 27            15 -  5\n   28 - 33            16 -  4\n   34 - 39            17 -  3\n   40 - 46            18 -  2\n   47 - 54            19 -  1\n   55 or more         20 -  0\nIn the example, if we were still 15 IMPs ahead having played 24 boards, using this table we would win the match 13-7. If the match was part of some larger competition, such as a league, then we would score 13 victory points and our opponents would score 7. \n\n  There are also events in which many teams of four compete. There are various ways of organising these. At any particular time in such an event you will be playing a part of a match against some other team, and at some time your team-mates will play the other cards of the same boards against the other half of that same team. The scores are eventually compared to find how many IMPs you won or lost against that team.\n\nAnother way of scoring teams of four is akin to the matchpoint scoring used in pairs (see below). On each board you simply win, tie, or lose depending on whether you score better, worse or the same as the other team. This method is known as board-a-match or BAM in America; in Britain it is usually called point-a-board.\n\nPairs\n\nThis is the game most usually played in Bridge clubs, and there are also many tournaments organised this way. As implied by the name, it is played between a number of fixed partnerships or pairs. For a pairs event you need a minimum of three tables (6 pairs, 12 players), and it works better with more players - say 10 tables (40 players) or more. With a very large number of players (say more than 70) it is usual to split the tournament into two or more separate sections.\n\nGenerally you play two or three boards at a table - this is called a round - and then one or both pairs move to another table and play other boards against other opponents. The movement will be organised by the director in such a way that no one ever plays boards they have played before, or against opponents they have played before.\n\n\nTraditionally, the score for each hand was recorded to a travelling scoresheet or traveller, which was kept in the board, folded so that previous scores could not be read, either in a special pocket provided for this purpose, or in the North pocket on top of North\'s cards. None of the players may look at this sheet before the board has been played. North is then responsible for entering the result and showing the completed sheet to East-West to check that it has been done correctly. Each pair has a number to identify them, and this must also be entered on the scoresheet, to show whose result it is. North is also responsible for the movement of the boards - checking at the start of the round that the correct boards are being played and passing them on at the end of the round.\n\n\nAt the end of the whole session, each scoresheet will contain the results of all the pairs who have played that board. The scoresheets are then collected by the organisers and the scores compared. The usual method of scoring is in matchpoints. Each pair is awarded 2 matchpoints for each pair who scored worse than them on that board, and 1 matchpoint for each pair who scored equally. (In North America it is customary to count just one matchpoint for each pair scoring worse than you on a board, and half a matchpoint for those that are equal.  This obviously makes no difference to the final ranking order or percentages scored by the pairs. Half points are traditionally written as a horizontal or diagonal stroke:  or /.\n)\nA completed score sheet might look like this:\n\n                   Board No. 1\n Pair No.                         North-South   Matchpoints\n NS   EW   Contract  By  Tricks   Plus  Minus    NS     EW\n  1    8      4S      N    10      420            5      7\n  2   13      3NT     S    10      430            8      4\n  3   11      5C*     E     8      500           12      0\n  4    9      4S      N    10      420            5      7\n  5   14      4S      N    11      450           10      2\n  6   12      5S      N    10             50      0     12\n  7   10      3S      N    10      170            2     10\n\nThen the total matchpoints scored by each pair over all the boards are calculated. This is generally converted to a percentage for each pair of the points they scored compared to the theoretical maximum. This gives a fair comparison between pairs who have played different numbers of boards. The winners are the pair with the highest percentage. There may be prizes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place, etc.\n\nAnother, less usual way of scoring pairs is with a version of the IMP scoring used for team matches (see above). There are two kinds of IMP pair games: your score may be IMPed against every other pair that played the same hands, or against a form of average of the scores of all the pairs who played the hand.\n\nSometimes the movement is such that the North-South pairs stay put and the East-West pairs remain East-West throughout. In this case the results for the East-West pairs and the North-South pairs are separate, and there are two winning pairs. To enable all the pairs to be placed in a single ranking order, the last round is sometimes played with an arrow switch. This means that the players who were previously North-South play the East-West cards for that round and vice versa.\n\n\nI am told that in many North American tournaments "pickup slips" were used instead of travellers - that is, there was an individual score slip for each table in each round. After North had filled out the details and East or West had checked it, it was left face down on the table and picked up by the organisers during the next round. This facilitated the calculation of final scores by computer, as the results of earlier rounds could be entered while the later rounds are being played. It also prevented players from seeing the results obtained by other players who previously played the same cards, which might be considered an advantage or a disadvantage. \nNowadays it is increasingly common for scores to be entered directly into a computer terminal at the table. These can be configured to provide or not to provide information about previous results for that board, and can be set  to ask the person entering the details to also record the opening lead.\nDuplicate Bridge procedure and ethics\n\nDuring a duplicate event, where play will be in progress at several tables at the same time, it is important that players do not see, overhear or otherwise take an interest in the play at the other tables. Any attempt to do so would be cheating, as it might give unauthorised information about the distribution of cards or the result of a board which the player would later be playing. For similar reasons, partners should not discuss the boards they have played in the hearing of other players until the end of the event (or a suitable break at a time when everyone has played the same boards).\n\n\nIn many places devices are used to enable the bidding to proceed silently, reducing the chance of hearing bids from another table. The best arrangement is for each player to have a bidding box, which is a box containing cards displaying all the possible bids, pass, double and redouble. At your turn you display the relevant card. All the cards used for bids remain on view until the end of the auction, thus also avoiding the problem of players forgetting or mishearing part of the bidding. A cheaper but less satisfactory method is to use a large card with a compartment for each possible bid; at your turn you point to the bid you wish to make. I am told that in Australia, overhearing of bids is commonly avoided by requiring bids to be written down rather than spoken.\n\nIn an event of any size, there will be a tournament director whose job is to ensure that the play flows smoothly. This person will deal with any infringements of the rules that occur, referring when necessary to the laws. If some irregularity occurs, such as a bid out or play out of turn, an illegal bid or play, or discovering that the cards have been wrongly boarded (the hands contain more or fewer than 13 cards), the director should be called to the table. This should not be construed as an accusation of cheating - the purpose of calling the director is simply to ensure that the irregularity is sorted out fairly and in accordance with the rules. The instructions and decisions of the director should be followed and respected at all times. In a serious tournament, if you strongly disagree with the director\'s ruling, it should be possible to appeal against the director\'s decision. The procedure for this varies according to the nature of the event - the director should be able to advise you on the options.\n\nStop and alert\n\nIn tournament Bridge, if you make a bid at a level higher than necessary in that denomination (a "jump" bid), you are supposed to precede your bid by saying "stop" (or displaying your "stop" card if you are using bidding boxes). The next player must then pause before bidding or passing. The reason behind this is that after a jump bid the next player may have reason to hesitate, as your unexpectedly high bid might have disrupted the course of action which that player was planning. The player is forced by the stop rule to hesitate anyway, so avoiding giving unauthorised information. Example:\n\nNorth bids "one spade"\nEast bids "stop; three hearts"\nSouth pauses and then passes\n\nIf South had been planning to bid two spades, say, then he might need time after East\'s unexpected jump to decide whether a three spade bid would now be appropriate.  As South is forced to pause, North gets no clue as to whether the jump gave South a problem. Similarly, if South instead bids three spades after the mandatory    pause, he gives North no clue as to whether he was considering a pass instead. \n\n  The idea of alerts is to warn the opponents of a bid (or double or pass) which has an unexpected agreed meaning. It is always the duty of the partner of the bidder to alert the bid when required. If using bidding boxes, this is done by displaying the "alert" card. Otherwise the alert is given by saying "alert" or (in Britain but not in North America) by knocking the table. The definition of what bids require alerts varies from place to place - it is determined by the Bridge organisation under whose aegis the tournament is being held. In Britain, most artificial bids must be alerted; in North America, alerts are required for bids which diverge from a defined standard set of meanings.\n  \nSince the late 1990\'s, "announcements" have been introduced in some places.  When bids with certain specific meanings are made, the bidder\'s partner must say a specific phrase that explains the meaning of the bid. For example the partner of a player who makes an opening bid of "one no trump" might be required to disclose the partnership\'s agreed range of strength for that bid in "high-card points", by saying for example "12 to 14" or "16 to 18".\nUnauthorised information\n\nThis is information which you obtain in some other way than as a legitimate deduction from the bidding and play. Unauthorised information might arise from:\n\nhesitation or undue haste in bidding or playing a card\nseeing your partner\'s cards\nextraneous remarks made during the game; also gestures, tone of voice, etc.\nseeing or overhearing events at another table\n\n questions your partner asks about the bidding or play\n alerts/announcements made or not made by your partner, or answers to \n  opponents\' questions, if they reveal that you and your partner \n  differ \n  as to the agreed meaning of your bids or plays \n\nThe principle is that you are allowed to take advantage of anything done by your opponents at your table, but you are obliged to ignore any unauthorised information gained from your partner\'s actions or from other tables. \n\n  In fact if you do obtain unauthorised information from your partner, you should not only ignore it but be prepared to prove that you have done so. This means that if you are involved in any kind of close decision you ought to take the action opposite to the one indicated by the information from your partner. For example if during the bidding your partner passes after a hesitation, you must pass too unless you have a cast iron case for bidding, otherwise you might be accused of making use of the unauthorised information that your partner had nearly enough strength to bid.\n\nDeception\n\nIn Bridge it is illegal to behave deliberately in such a way as to try to give spurious information to the opponents. For example if you have only one card of a suit that is led, it is illegal to hesitate before playing it, creating the impression that you had more than one card to choose from. (Even an inadvertent hesitation would be an offence, though a less serious one, if it misled the opponents to your benefit, and the director would adjust the score to give a fair result.) On the other hand there is no ban on making deceptive bids and plays to confuse the opponents - as long as these are not part of an undisclosed partnership agreement. You are free for example to play a card different from what might be expected from your holding, provided that you play the card smoothly and without comment. Similarly you are free to make a bid which is inconsistent with your system to upset the opposition, provided that this is as much of a surprise to your partner as it is to the opponents.\n\nOf course you must always bid and play  legally, in turn and in accordance with the ranking of bids, the rules of following suit, and so on, even if your choice of bid or play is unorthodox and unexpected.\nChicago\n\nThere are several versions of this game, also known in the official rules as Four-Deal Bridge. As this name suggests it is a game for four players which is complete in four deals, unlike Rubber Bridge, where the length of a rubber is indefinite. This greater predictability has made it popular in some American clubs where Rubber was formerly played.\n\nThe vulnerability varies from hand to hand in a fixed pattern as follows:\n\nHand 1: Dealer North; neither side vulnerable\nHand 2: Dealer East; North-South vulnerable\nHand 3: Dealer South; East-West vulnerable\nHand 4: Dealer West; both sides vulnerable\n\nIf all four players pass, the cards are shuffled again and the hand redealt by the same dealer. The game bonus is 500 when vulnerable, 300 when not vulnerable. If a team makes a part score this is carried forward to subsequent deals until one side makes a game. If a team makes a part score in hand 4 that is not sufficient to complete a game, they score a bonus of 100, but there is no bonus for any part scores made in earlier hands. \n\nExample of scoring\n\n\n                         N-S     |   E-W\n                                 |\n                        100 (d)  |\n                         50 (d)  |\n                        200 (d)  |   500 (c)\n                         60 (a)  |    30 (c)\n                      ===========|===========\n 1. N deals, love all    60 (a)  |\n                                 |\n 2. E deals, N-S vul             |    40 (b)\n                                 |\n 3. S deals, E-W vul             |    60 (c)\n                      -----------|-----------\n 4. W deals, game all    80 (d)  |\n\n                      ====================\n Totals                  550          630      so E-W win by 80.\n(a) On hand 1, N-S bid two spades and made 10 tricks, scoring 60 points below the line plus 60 above for the overtricks. No game here because N-S\'s score below the line is less than 100.\n  (b) On hand 2, E-W bid one no trump and made exactly seven tricks, for 40 points.\n  (c) On hand 3, E-W bid two hearts and won 9 tricks for 60 points below and 30 above. This brings their score below the line to 100, which counts as a vulnerable game because E-W are vulnerable for this hand, even though this is the first game they have made.\n  (d) On hand 4, the final hand, N-S bid one no trump; although they are doubled, they succeed in making eight tricks. This is worth 80 (2*40) below the line, and above the line they score 200 for one vulnerable overtrick plus 50 for making a doubled contract. However, this is not a game: their 60 below the line from hand 1 no longer counts towards game because of the game E-W made in hand 3. Therefore N-S score just a further 100 for finishing with a part score.\n\nNote: the original version of Chicago had the vulnerability reversed in hands 2 and 3, so that the dealing side was vulnerable. The more modern scheme, which has the non-dealing side vulnerable as shown above, tends to lead to more competitive bidding.\n  \nChicago with Duplicate Scoring\n\nChicago is sometimes played using duplicate scoring. There is no accumulation of part scores or games from deal to deal - each deal is scored separately, and a team making a part score gets an immediate bonus of 50 as in duplicate. The sequence of vulnerability is fixed as in the standard version.\n\nA multiple of four hands can be played, repeating the sequence of vulnerabilities as often as necessary. The result is simply the total score over the deals played.\n\nChicago with Russian Scoring\n\nThe following method of scoring Chicago originated in Russia. It eliminates some of the luck of the deal by introducing an element of IMPs scoring.\n\nOn each deal, there is a target score which depends on the number of high card points held. The cards are played in front of the players, as in duplicate. At the end of the play, the high card points held by each side are counted, according to the following scale:\n\neach ace: 4 points\neach king: 3 points\neach queen: 2 points\neach jack: 1 point\n\nThere are 40 points in all. The team which held more high card points finds its target score, which depends on whether they were vulnerable or not, from the following table:\n High Card           Target\n Points       Not Vul.  Vulnerable\n   20              0          0\n   21             50         50\n   22             70         70\n   23            110        110\n   24            200        290\n   25            300        440\n   26            350        520\n   27            400        600\n   28            430        630\n   29            460        660\n   30            490        690\n   31            600        900\n   32            700       1050\n   33            900       1350\n   34           1000       1500\n   35           1100       1650\n   36           1200       1800\n   37           1300       1950\n   38           1300       1950\n   39           1300       1950\n   40           1300       1950\nThe difference between the target score from the above table and the actual score is then converted to IMPs, using the standard IMP table. The total IMP scores over a series of hands are totaled to give an overall result.\nFor example, suppose we are East-West, and on the second deal of a Chicago we bid three hearts and make 10 tricks. We then count our high card points and discover that between us we had 24. We were vulnerable, so our target score from the table was 290. We actually scored 170 (90 for the contract plus 30 for the overtrick plus 50 for the part score). So we are 120 points short of our target. Therefore using the IMP table, our score for this hand is minus 3 IMPs.\nSecond example. In the first deal of a Chicago we bid and make 4 Spades holding only 18 points between us. Our opponents had a target of 70 but instead we made 420. The difference is 490 so we score plus 10 IMPs.\nThere are several alternative versions of this scoring table. In Estonia, a compensation table is used which also takes into account the fit between the hands of the partners with the majority of high card points. The details are available on Tanel Teinemaa\'s Compensation Table web site.\nThe Beer Card\n\nThe Beer Card is the Seven of Diamonds. It is not part of the official rules of Bridge, but there is a tradition among some players that if the declarer succeeds in making the contract and wins the last trick with the Seven of Diamonds, dummy must buy the declarer a beer of the declarer\'s choice. In the same way, if the opponents defeat the contract and one of them wins the last trick with the Seven of Diamonds, the opponent who wins the last trick is bought a beer by the other opponent.\nThe Beer Card tradition originated in Copenhagen in the 1950\'s or 1960\'s. It was probably inspired by:\n\nthe large reward for winning the last trick with a King or the Pagat (lowest trump) in the game of Danish Tarok, or the bonus for winning the last trick with the trump 7 (the lowest trump) in the Danish form of Skat;\nthe fact that the diamond seven is a valuable card in the system of bommelommer points - a way of evaluating a Bridge hand which has little or no connection with its usefulness in the game of Bridge, but was used in some Danish clubs as the basis of a side-bet between partners. Bommerlommer is a slightly old-fashioned Danish slang word for money.\n\nHoneymoon Bridge\nBridge has become so popular and fashionable that some players can hardly believe that any other card game is worth learning, but Bridge is a four-player game. When two such people want to play cards and no other players are available, instead of playing a card game designed for two players, they sometimes prefer to resort to two-player adaptations of Bridge, known as Honeymoon Bridge. There are several different versions, all somewhat unsatisfactory. Rules can be found on the Honeymoon Bridge page of this site.\nMinibridge\nMinibridge is a simplified version of Bridge that was introduced in Europe in the 1990\'s as a teaching aid for new players. In its most straightforward form it works as follows.\nAfter the cards are dealt as usual, the players look at their cards and count the number of high card points they hold according to the following scale: ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, other cards zero. This is the popular Milton Work point count used by many Bridge players to evaluate the approximate strength of a hand for bidding purposes. But instead of bidding in the usual way, in Minibridge each player in turn, beginning with the dealer, simply announces his or her point count. The point counts of the four players should add up to 40. The partnership with the higher total point count plays the contract, the declarer being the whichever player of that partnership holds more points. If each partnership has 20 points there is a redeal by the same dealer. If both members of the declaring partnership have the same number of points (for example 12 each), the declarer is the member of the partnership who spoke first - that is the dealer or the player to dealer\'s left.\nThe declarer\'s partner puts down the dummy, and the declarer, having seen partner\'s hand announces whether the contract will be a "game" or a "part score" and also the trump suit or "no trumps". Then the player to declarer\'s left leads to the first trick and play proceeds as in normal Bridge.\nThe scores for each trick above six are as usual: 20 if trumps were clubs or diamonds, 30 if trumps were hearts or spades, and 40 for the first trick and 30 for each subsequent trick if there are no trumps.\n\nIf the contract was "part score", it succeeds if the declarer\'s side wins at least seven tricks. The winning  side scores the trick score plus a bonus of 50 points.\nIf the contract was "game", it succeeds if the declarer\'s side wins enough tricks to score at least 100 trick points - in other words at least 11 tricks if clubs or diamonds are trumps, at least 10 tricks if hearts or spades are trumps, or at least 9 tricks if there are no trumps. In this case the declarer\'s side scores the trick score plus a bonus of 300 for the "game".\nIf the contract fails, the declarer\'s opponents score 50 points for each trick by which the declarer was short of the number needed to make the contract.\n\nExamples: \n\nPart score in no trumps. For 7 tricks declarer\'s side would score 90. For 10 tricks they would score 180. if they took 5 tricks the other side would score 100.\nGame in hearts. For 10 tricks declarer\'s side would score 420. For 11 tricks they would score 450. If they took 7 tricks the other side would score 150.\n\nThere is no set overall target score. Players play an agreed number of deals after which scores are compared to give the result.\nThere are several more elaborate versions of Minibridge played in various parts of Europe. For example instead of players announcing their points, each player writes on a slip of paper the number of points and the number of cards held in each suit. Then players speak in turn, starting with the dealer, the options being "pass" or "I open". If all pass the cards are redealt. If a player opens, the opener\'s partner\'s slip is passed to the opener, and the opener uses this to choose a contract, which is like a bid in Contract Bridge - a number of tricks above six and a trump suit or no trumps. After this, the opener\'s left-hand opponent receives his or her partner\'s slip and can either pass or "overcall". If the opponent passes the opener\'s contract is played. If the opponent overcalls, he or she must name a contract higher than the opener\'s bid: either more tricks or the same number of tricks in a higher denomination. The opener can then bid again, and the overcaller and opener continue to bid alternately, each bid being higher than the last, until one of them passes. The final bidder becomes the declarer and plays the final contract.\nFurther information about Minibridge can be found on the English Bridge Union\'s Minibridge pages.\nIn some places, declarers are provided with a "decision table" to help them to decide what contract to announce.

There are several versions. All of them use a 52-card pack, with suits and cards in each suit ranking as in Bridge. Scoring is the same as in Rubber Bridge.\n\nDraw Bridge\nDraw and Discard Bridge\nDouble Dummy Bridge\nSingle Dummy Bridge\nBridge with Semi-exposed Dummies\nMemory Bridge\nBridgette\n\nDraw Bridge\nTwo players use a 52 card pack. Suits and cards in each suit rank as in Bridge.\nThe dealer shuffles and dealer\'s opponent cuts. The dealer deals 13 cards to each player, one at a time. The remaining 26 cards are placed face down to form a pile from which cards are drawn during play. This is known as the stock.\nThe first 13 tricks are played at no trump. Non dealer leads to the first trick, and it is not necessary to follow suit. These tricks do not count towards the score - they are simply discarded - but the winner of each trick draws the top card from the top of the stock and the loser takes the next card. When drawing a card you add it to your hand without showing it to your opponent.\nAfter 13 tricks each player still has 13 cards, and if they have very good memories they will know each other\'s hands. The players now bid as in Contract Bridge (doubles and redoubles are allowed), until one player passes. The final contract is then played, the opponent of the bidder leading to the first trick. Suit must be followed, as in Bridge.\nVariations\nSome players turn the top card of the stock face up before the lead to each trick, so in the first 13 tricks you know what card you will pick up if you win the trick (but not if you lose).\nSome play that you have to follow suit in the first 13 tricks. However, since following suit is not enforceable when players draw new cards after each trick, it is probably better to play that you don\'t have to. In the last 13 tricks suit must always be followed as in Bridge.\nDraw and Discard Bridge\nNo cards are dealt, but after shuffling and cutting, the 52 cards are stacked face down. The players take turns to draw cards as follows: at your turn you look at the top card of the stock (without showing it to your opponent). You may either take this card and add it to your hand, or discard it to a face down discard pile. If you reject the first stock card you must take the next stock card and add it to the hand. If you take the first stock card you look at the next stock card and must discard it face down. Players take alternate turns until the stock is exhausted. At this time, each player has a hand of 13 cards, and has seen 13 of the 26 cards in the discard pile, but does not know which of the other 26 cards are in the opponent\'s hand.\nThe players now bid as in Contract Bridge (doubles and redoubles are allowed), until one player passes. The final contract is then played, the opponent of the bidder leading to the first trick. Suit must be followed, as in Bridge.\nVariations\nSome play that in the drawing, a player who accepts the top card of the stock does not look at and discard the next card. In this version, there will generally be some stock cards left over when each player has collected their 13 cards. Neither player knows what these remaining stock cards are.\nDouble Dummy Bridge\nThe two active players sit next to each other. Four 13-card hands are dealt as in Bridge - a hand for each player and two dummy hands. The hand opposite each player is their dummy, but they cannot look at it until after the bidding.\nThe two players bid as in Contract Bridge (doubles and redoubles allowed) until one player passes. The players then look at their own dummies, but do not show them to each other until after the opening lead.\nThe declarer\'s opponent leads a card to the first trick from the hand that will be to declarer\'s left: this will be the opponent\'s own hand if the declarer is the right-hand player, but the opponent\'s dummy if the declarer is the left-hand player. Both dummies are then exposed on the table, opposite their owners, and play continues as in Bridge, each of the players playing cards from their own dummy at its turn.\nVariations\nSome play that neither dummy is exposed to the opponent. After the end of the bidding, the dummy cards are placed in racks so that they are visible to the owner throughout the play, but not to the other player. Hans Peter Albach suggests that when playing this way, the two players should sit facing each other across the table, each having their opponent\'s rack in front of them to their left. So if South and East are the real players, with North and West as their dummy partners, the arrangement and sequence of play looks like this:\n\nTo eliminate any positional advantage in sitting to the left or right, some play that the hands are always arranged, after the bidding, in the clockwise order: opponent\'s dummy, declarer\'s dummy, opponent, declarer. In this case the opponent\'s dummy leads to the first trick.\nSome deal just 12 cards to each player initially. Players may look at their own dummies during the bidding. After the bidding, the dealer deals two more cards to each player. The players look at these extra cards and choose which to add to their own hand and which to their dummy. \nSingle Dummy Bridge\nFour hands are dealt as in Double Dummy Bridge, but one hand is exposed before the bidding. After the bidding, the declarer chooses whether to have the exposed dummy or the other dummy as a partner. Either way, the second dummy is then exposed and the play continues as in Double Dummy Bridge.\nBridge with Semi-Exposed Dummies\nThe players sit next to each other. Four 13-card hands are dealt. The hands belonging to the players are dealt normally, but each of the dummies are arranged with six cards face down in a row, one face up card on top of each face down card, and a seventh face up card at the end of the row with no card under it. Each active player owns and plays the dummy opposite them.\nThe two players bid as at Contract Bridge (doubles and redoubles allowed) until one player passes. In this version each player can of course see seven cards of each dummy as well as their own cards during the bidding. The hand to the declarer\'s left leads to the first trick.\nWhen it is the turn of a dummy hand to play, its owner plays a face up card from it, obeying the usual rules of following suit. If this exposes a face down card, that card is turned face up at the end of the trick.\nMemory Bridge\n13 cards are dealt to each player and played at no trump. Suit must be followed, and there is no drawing of replacement cards as in Draw Bridge. The player who makes seven or more tricks scores as though they had played a contract of 1NT, and gets an additional premium of 100 above the line.\nThe remaining cards are then dealt, 13 to each player, and bid, played and scored as in Bridge.\nBridgette\n\nThis game, first published by J.Q.Kansil in 1970, uses a special 55-card  pack consistaining three extra cards known as Colons: the Grand Colon matches aces; the Royal Colon matches Face cards (K,Q,J) and the Little Colon matches the numeral cards 2-10. A Colon can be discarded on a matching lead: it loses the trick but stops the opponent from leading a card of the same suit to the next trick.

It is popular in Italy and it uses the Italian 40 card deck. It is often played with Italian cards, which have suits of coins, cups, batons and swords, but you  may play using a standard international 52-card deck, just by removing the Jokers, eights, nines and tens. The same game is played in the coastal regions of Slovenia and Croatia under the name Brikula. \nBriscola may be played with two, three, four or six players. There is a special version for five players, which is strongly recommended.\n\nRank and value of cards\n\nIn order to define which card wins a particular trick, we must first define a card ranking, given from highest to lowest:\nace, three, king, queen, jack, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2.\n\nAlso, the cards have a point value:\n\n\n\nAce\n11 points\n\n\nThree\n10 points\n\n\nKing\n4 points\n\n\nQueen\n3 points\n\n\nJack\n2 points\n\n\nThe remaining cards have no point value. \nBriscola is often played with Italian cards with suits of swords (spade), clubs (bastoni), cups (coppe) and coins (danari).  In this case the picture cards rank in the order King (re) (4 points), Horse (cavallo) (3 points), Jack (fante) (2 points). In North America, Italian cards in various regional patterns can be obtained from TaroBear\'s Lair.\n\nAs you see, the total value of cards in the deck adds up to 120 points. The player (or team) which scores at least 61 points in a game wins. Games can end in a draw when both reach the same point total (60), and usually Briscola is played to the best of three or five games.\n\nNote on card order\nMost books, when describing how to play Briscola with French suited cards (hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades) use the above card order King (4), Queen (3), Jack (2), which is normal in northern Italy. However, many players, especially in the south, reverse the role of the Queen and Jack. The card order is then Ace (11), Three (10), King (4), Jack (3), Queen (2), 7, 6, 5, 4, 2.\nTwo player Briscola\n\nThis is the easiest version of the game, and will serve as a basis for the multiplayer versions.\n\nOne of the two players shuffles the deck and deals three cards to each player. He then takes a card (the seventh, in this case) and puts it face up near the pile of undealt cards, which are placed face down. The face-up card suit defines which will be the Briscola suit for the game. The Briscola suit is the trump suit, i.e. the suit which always takes all other cards, card ranking notwithstanding.\n\nThe game starts. The first to play is the player to the right of the dealer. In the two player version, this means that the non-dealer (A) will start.\n\nA leads one of his three cards, face up.\n\nB plays one of his cards, and wins or loses the trick according to these\nthree simple rules:\n\nIf B plays a card of the same suit as the card led by A, then the trick    is won by whoever played the higher card - the winner takes both cards away, and puts them, face down, in a pile near him.\nIf B plays a card which has a different suit from the card which A led, but neither card is a Briscola (trump), A wins the trick, and the cards will go to A, even if B\'s card was of higher rank.\nIf B plays a card of a different suit from A\'s, and one of the cards is a Briscola (trump), then the player of the Briscola wins the trick.\n\n\nExample (Briscola is the four of spades):\n\nPlayer A leads the 5 of clubs.\nPlayer B plays the ace of clubs. B takes the trick (Rule 1).\n\n\nPlayer A leads the 5 of hearts.\nPlayer B plays the King of clubs. Player A takes the trick (Rule 2)\n\n\nPlayer A leads the ace of diamonds.\nPlayer B plays 6 of spades (briscola). He wins the round (Rule 3).\n\n\nNote that Briscola is unlike many card games, in that there is no obligation for the second player to play a card of the same suit as the first card or to trump it, just because he can. The second player is free to play any of his cards.\n\nNote that if both players play a briscola, rule 1 dictates that the higher ranking card wins.\n\n\nAfter each trick, each player draws a card from the pile of undealt cards. The winner of the trick draws first, followed by the loser. The player who won the trick then leads to the next one.\n\n\nEventually the undealt cards will be used up, and at this point the loser of the trick just played  will draw the face up Briscola card. The game then continues, without drawing cards, until all the cards have been played.\n\nAt the end, each player takes the pile of cards he won in tricks during the game, and counts up the points according to the point scale shown above. The player with more points wins, or if each has 60, it is a draw.\n\n\nVariations\n\nSome people play that if the turned-up card, the one that   indicates the trump suit, is an ace or a three (the two strongest cards), the card is put back in the middle of the deck and another card is turned up.\n\n\nSome play that the winner is the first player to reach 120 points: unless one player wins all the tricks this will take two deals, one by each player.\nFour player Briscola\n\nThe game remains more or less the same, but the two pairs of players sit face to face, and each pair plays as a team, like in Bridge. Playing proceeds counter-clockwise.\n\nWhen playing the 4 or 6 players versions, players should avoid talking about the cards they have in hand. However, some players use a system of signalling, using facial expressions to indicate what cards they have.\n\nThe player to the right of the dealer leads first. The other players may play ANY card (there is no requirement to follow suit). If no one plays a Briscola the trick is won by the highest\ncard of the suit led. If one or more players plays a Briscola, the highest Briscola wins.\n\nEach player in turn, starting with the winner of the trick, then draws a card from the undealt pile. The winner of the trick then leads to the next one.\n\nWhen the undealt cards are used up, the next player draws the Briscola card, and the game continues without drawing until all the cards have been played.\nExample:\n\nThe players are A, B, C, D, placed around a table like this:\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\nD\n\nB\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\nA and C play together against B and D. A deals the cards. Briscola (the thirteenth card) comes up as a three of hearts.\n\nD, who sits counter-clockwise from A, plays first, and leads the 4 of spades.\nC plays the Jack of spades.\nB plays the two of hearts.\nIf A does not play a higher Briscola, all four the cards will go to the D & B team.\nA thinks that for this meagre booty (the Jack is only two points, after all) it is not worth using a Briscola, or perhaps he does not have one; anyway, he plays the 5 of clubs.\nThe trick is taken by the B & D team.\nB leads to the next trick.\n\nSignals\n\nOne system of signals in use to indicate high Briscola cards is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nAce \nstretch the lips over the teeth\n\n\nThree\ndistort the mouth to one side\n\n\nKing \nglance upwards\n\n\nQueen/Knight \nshow the tip of the tongue\n\n\nJack\nshrug one shoulder\n\n\nSix player Briscola\n\nThis works in the same way as the four player version. The two teams are made up of three players each:\n\n\n\nAB\n\nDC\nEF\n\nA, C and E play against D, B, F. The deck is reduced to 36 cards by taking away the two\'s. \nThree player Briscola\n\nIt\'s played the same as the two player version, and the deck is reduced to 39 cards by taking away a 2. All three players try to gain the highest number of points.\n\nBriscola Bastarda [Five player variant]\n\nBriscola Bastarda (Bastard Briscola), also known as Briscola Chiamata (Call Briscola) is probably the most enjoyable version of this game.  The base mechanics remain the same, i.e. object of the game remains to gain the highest number of points, a briscola suit exists and so on, but there are two important twists to the basic game.\n\nThe deal\n\nAll the 40 cards are distributed among the players. Each receives eight cards, so no cards remain on the table, and everyone sees from the start all the cards in his/her hand.\n\nBidding\n\nStarting with the player to the right of the dealer, everyone in turn "declares" how many points he will probably score in the game, based on the cards he has in hand. Each bid must be higher than the previous one; a player who does not wish to bid higher can pass. A player who has passed cannot bid again during the auction. The bidding continues, for several rounds if necessary, until all the players except one have passed.\n\nThe highest bidder then "calls" the Briscola, i.e. decides which card will act as Briscola for the game. He declares which is the selected card to the other players. (Ace of clubs, for example). The called card identifies the briscola suit, but serves also to define which of the remaining players will team up with the first one: the three remaining players form a team which is opposed to the caller/holder pair.\n\nThe problem is that no-one, except the holder, knows which one of the players will team up with the caller.\n\nPlay\n\nThe actual play is the same as in a "traditional" Briscola game. The play continues until all cards have been played.\n\nThe holder should avoid revealing his identity until the time comes\nto play the called card. The other players should try to\ndeduce which player is playing with the caller, and adjust\ntheir strategy accordingly.\n\nScoring\n\nAt the end of the game, points gained by the caller and by the holder are counted together.\n\nIf the total is equal to or more than what the caller declared before the game, he gets 2 points, the holder takes 1 points, and the three other players get -1 (negative) point each. If the total is less than the declared amount, the three players get 1 points each, while the caller loses 2 points and the holder 1 point.\n\nAt the start of the game, the players should agree how many points  they will play to - usually 10-15 points. Further games are played  until someone wins by reaching this total.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThe caller can, if he has an exceptionally good hand, call for a card he has in its own hand. This will gain (or lose) him 4 points, while his opponents still gain/lose 1 point each.\n\nThe game is extremely funny: players need to decide whose side the others are on, mainly by observing the cards played during a round (it\'s forbidden to talk about the cards in one\'s own hand, as usual). The holder should walk a thin line between gaining points for himself and his partner, while avoiding being discovered too soon.\n\nVariation\n\nSome people play a different method of bidding. Players state the rank of the Briscola they wish to call (e.g. ace, three, king, ...), the objective being always to win at least 61 points. Each player in turn must pass or bid a lower rank than the previous bidder. So the bidding is won by whoever is prepared to call the lowest card. If someone bids "two", the bidding can continue by other players offering to call a two and win more than 61 points, and then the player who was prepared to call a two and win most points would win the bidding.\n\n\n\nBrikula in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nVeselko Kelava reports that in Bosnia and Herzegovina Brikula is  played with a 32-card pack, each suit ranking: A, 10, K, Q, J, 9, 8, 7. The card values are A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2. Any number  can  play without partnerships, or four can play as partners, two against two. When the talon comes  close to an end and some players draw and some don\'t get a chance. Only  those who drew play to the following trick, so that all again have the  same number of cards in hand.\nFour-card or double Brikula\nIn both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, a variation is played in which four cards (instead of three) are dealt to each player, and everyone plays twice to each trick: after everyone has played one card, the play continues around the table and all play a second card. Whoever plays the highest trump or if there are none, the highest card of the suit that was led takes all the cards of the double trick. Everyone in turn draws a card from the talon and then everyone draws a second card so that all have four cards again, and the winner of the previous trick leads to a new double trick.\nOther Briscola WWW sites and software\nThe freeware and PRO versions of Gianfranco Marzano\'s Briscola computer program are available from his Home Page dei giochi di carte italiani.\nAt the Italian site Tretre you can play Briscola on line against live players or against the computer, and also find rules of Briscola and several variants.\nAt GiochiStars you can play two-player Briscola games and tournaments online against live opponents\n \nWith Orfeo Bernardo\'s Briscola Mano a Mano you can play against the computer or against a live opponent.\nan Kafol has developed a Flash web site providing online multiplayer brikola (briscola) for 2, 3 or 4 players.\nAt Davide Gullo\'s GDM community site you can play Briscola Chiamata on line.\nWith the two-player Briscola program at  Solitari con le Carte you can now play online against the computer using any web browser.\nYou can play Briscola and Briscola Chiamata on line at the Italian site biska.com.\nHere is Brian Friesen\'s freeware Briscola program for Windows.\nYou can download a freeware Briscola program from Thanos Card Games.\nWith the free Windows program BTM Pro, obtainable from Drazen\'s homepage, you can play Briscola and some other Italian games against the computer or against other players over a network.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Ace-Ten Games > Briscola\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1995, 2003, 2005, 2010, 2012.

It is popular in Italy and it uses the Italian 40 card deck. It is often played with Italian cards, which have suits of coins, cups, batons and swords, but you  may play using a standard international 52-card deck, just by removing the Jokers, eights, nines and tens. The same game is played in the coastal regions of Slovenia and Croatia under the name Brikula. \nBriscola may be played with two, three, four or six players. There is a special version for five players, which is strongly recommended.\n\nRank and value of cards\n\nIn order to define which card wins a particular trick, we must first define a card ranking, given from highest to lowest:\nace, three, king, queen, jack, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2.\n\nAlso, the cards have a point value:\n\n\n\nAce\n11 points\n\n\nThree\n10 points\n\n\nKing\n4 points\n\n\nQueen\n3 points\n\n\nJack\n2 points\n\n\nThe remaining cards have no point value. \nBriscola is often played with Italian cards with suits of swords (spade), clubs (bastoni), cups (coppe) and coins (danari).  In this case the picture cards rank in the order King (re) (4 points), Horse (cavallo) (3 points), Jack (fante) (2 points). In North America, Italian cards in various regional patterns can be obtained from TaroBear\'s Lair.\n\nAs you see, the total value of cards in the deck adds up to 120 points. The player (or team) which scores at least 61 points in a game wins. Games can end in a draw when both reach the same point total (60), and usually Briscola is played to the best of three or five games.\n\nNote on card order\nMost books, when describing how to play Briscola with French suited cards (hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades) use the above card order King (4), Queen (3), Jack (2), which is normal in northern Italy. However, many players, especially in the south, reverse the role of the Queen and Jack. The card order is then Ace (11), Three (10), King (4), Jack (3), Queen (2), 7, 6, 5, 4, 2.\nTwo player Briscola\n\nThis is the easiest version of the game, and will serve as a basis for the multiplayer versions.\n\nOne of the two players shuffles the deck and deals three cards to each player. He then takes a card (the seventh, in this case) and puts it face up near the pile of undealt cards, which are placed face down. The face-up card suit defines which will be the Briscola suit for the game. The Briscola suit is the trump suit, i.e. the suit which always takes all other cards, card ranking notwithstanding.\n\nThe game starts. The first to play is the player to the right of the dealer. In the two player version, this means that the non-dealer (A) will start.\n\nA leads one of his three cards, face up.\n\nB plays one of his cards, and wins or loses the trick according to these\nthree simple rules:\n\nIf B plays a card of the same suit as the card led by A, then the trick    is won by whoever played the higher card - the winner takes both cards away, and puts them, face down, in a pile near him.\nIf B plays a card which has a different suit from the card which A led, but neither card is a Briscola (trump), A wins the trick, and the cards will go to A, even if B\'s card was of higher rank.\nIf B plays a card of a different suit from A\'s, and one of the cards is a Briscola (trump), then the player of the Briscola wins the trick.\n\n\nExample (Briscola is the four of spades):\n\nPlayer A leads the 5 of clubs.\nPlayer B plays the ace of clubs. B takes the trick (Rule 1).\n\n\nPlayer A leads the 5 of hearts.\nPlayer B plays the King of clubs. Player A takes the trick (Rule 2)\n\n\nPlayer A leads the ace of diamonds.\nPlayer B plays 6 of spades (briscola). He wins the round (Rule 3).\n\n\nNote that Briscola is unlike many card games, in that there is no obligation for the second player to play a card of the same suit as the first card or to trump it, just because he can. The second player is free to play any of his cards.\n\nNote that if both players play a briscola, rule 1 dictates that the higher ranking card wins.\n\n\nAfter each trick, each player draws a card from the pile of undealt cards. The winner of the trick draws first, followed by the loser. The player who won the trick then leads to the next one.\n\n\nEventually the undealt cards will be used up, and at this point the loser of the trick just played  will draw the face up Briscola card. The game then continues, without drawing cards, until all the cards have been played.\n\nAt the end, each player takes the pile of cards he won in tricks during the game, and counts up the points according to the point scale shown above. The player with more points wins, or if each has 60, it is a draw.\n\n\nVariations\n\nSome people play that if the turned-up card, the one that   indicates the trump suit, is an ace or a three (the two strongest cards), the card is put back in the middle of the deck and another card is turned up.\n\n\nSome play that the winner is the first player to reach 120 points: unless one player wins all the tricks this will take two deals, one by each player.\nFour player Briscola\n\nThe game remains more or less the same, but the two pairs of players sit face to face, and each pair plays as a team, like in Bridge. Playing proceeds counter-clockwise.\n\nWhen playing the 4 or 6 players versions, players should avoid talking about the cards they have in hand. However, some players use a system of signalling, using facial expressions to indicate what cards they have.\n\nThe player to the right of the dealer leads first. The other players may play ANY card (there is no requirement to follow suit). If no one plays a Briscola the trick is won by the highest\ncard of the suit led. If one or more players plays a Briscola, the highest Briscola wins.\n\nEach player in turn, starting with the winner of the trick, then draws a card from the undealt pile. The winner of the trick then leads to the next one.\n\nWhen the undealt cards are used up, the next player draws the Briscola card, and the game continues without drawing until all the cards have been played.\nExample:\n\nThe players are A, B, C, D, placed around a table like this:\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\nD\n\nB\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\nA and C play together against B and D. A deals the cards. Briscola (the thirteenth card) comes up as a three of hearts.\n\nD, who sits counter-clockwise from A, plays first, and leads the 4 of spades.\nC plays the Jack of spades.\nB plays the two of hearts.\nIf A does not play a higher Briscola, all four the cards will go to the D & B team.\nA thinks that for this meagre booty (the Jack is only two points, after all) it is not worth using a Briscola, or perhaps he does not have one; anyway, he plays the 5 of clubs.\nThe trick is taken by the B & D team.\nB leads to the next trick.\n\nSignals\n\nOne system of signals in use to indicate high Briscola cards is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nAce \nstretch the lips over the teeth\n\n\nThree\ndistort the mouth to one side\n\n\nKing \nglance upwards\n\n\nQueen/Knight \nshow the tip of the tongue\n\n\nJack\nshrug one shoulder\n\n\nSix player Briscola\n\nThis works in the same way as the four player version. The two teams are made up of three players each:\n\n\n\nAB\n\nDC\nEF\n\nA, C and E play against D, B, F. The deck is reduced to 36 cards by taking away the two\'s. \nThree player Briscola\n\nIt\'s played the same as the two player version, and the deck is reduced to 39 cards by taking away a 2. All three players try to gain the highest number of points.\n\nBriscola Bastarda [Five player variant]\n\nBriscola Bastarda (Bastard Briscola), also known as Briscola Chiamata (Call Briscola) is probably the most enjoyable version of this game.  The base mechanics remain the same, i.e. object of the game remains to gain the highest number of points, a briscola suit exists and so on, but there are two important twists to the basic game.\n\nThe deal\n\nAll the 40 cards are distributed among the players. Each receives eight cards, so no cards remain on the table, and everyone sees from the start all the cards in his/her hand.\n\nBidding\n\nStarting with the player to the right of the dealer, everyone in turn "declares" how many points he will probably score in the game, based on the cards he has in hand. Each bid must be higher than the previous one; a player who does not wish to bid higher can pass. A player who has passed cannot bid again during the auction. The bidding continues, for several rounds if necessary, until all the players except one have passed.\n\nThe highest bidder then "calls" the Briscola, i.e. decides which card will act as Briscola for the game. He declares which is the selected card to the other players. (Ace of clubs, for example). The called card identifies the briscola suit, but serves also to define which of the remaining players will team up with the first one: the three remaining players form a team which is opposed to the caller/holder pair.\n\nThe problem is that no-one, except the holder, knows which one of the players will team up with the caller.\n\nPlay\n\nThe actual play is the same as in a "traditional" Briscola game. The play continues until all cards have been played.\n\nThe holder should avoid revealing his identity until the time comes\nto play the called card. The other players should try to\ndeduce which player is playing with the caller, and adjust\ntheir strategy accordingly.\n\nScoring\n\nAt the end of the game, points gained by the caller and by the holder are counted together.\n\nIf the total is equal to or more than what the caller declared before the game, he gets 2 points, the holder takes 1 points, and the three other players get -1 (negative) point each. If the total is less than the declared amount, the three players get 1 points each, while the caller loses 2 points and the holder 1 point.\n\nAt the start of the game, the players should agree how many points  they will play to - usually 10-15 points. Further games are played  until someone wins by reaching this total.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThe caller can, if he has an exceptionally good hand, call for a card he has in its own hand. This will gain (or lose) him 4 points, while his opponents still gain/lose 1 point each.\n\nThe game is extremely funny: players need to decide whose side the others are on, mainly by observing the cards played during a round (it\'s forbidden to talk about the cards in one\'s own hand, as usual). The holder should walk a thin line between gaining points for himself and his partner, while avoiding being discovered too soon.\n\nVariation\n\nSome people play a different method of bidding. Players state the rank of the Briscola they wish to call (e.g. ace, three, king, ...), the objective being always to win at least 61 points. Each player in turn must pass or bid a lower rank than the previous bidder. So the bidding is won by whoever is prepared to call the lowest card. If someone bids "two", the bidding can continue by other players offering to call a two and win more than 61 points, and then the player who was prepared to call a two and win most points would win the bidding.\n\n\n\nBrikula in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nVeselko Kelava reports that in Bosnia and Herzegovina Brikula is  played with a 32-card pack, each suit ranking: A, 10, K, Q, J, 9, 8, 7. The card values are A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2. Any number  can  play without partnerships, or four can play as partners, two against two. When the talon comes  close to an end and some players draw and some don\'t get a chance. Only  those who drew play to the following trick, so that all again have the  same number of cards in hand.\nFour-card or double Brikula\nIn both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, a variation is played in which four cards (instead of three) are dealt to each player, and everyone plays twice to each trick: after everyone has played one card, the play continues around the table and all play a second card. Whoever plays the highest trump or if there are none, the highest card of the suit that was led takes all the cards of the double trick. Everyone in turn draws a card from the talon and then everyone draws a second card so that all have four cards again, and the winner of the previous trick leads to a new double trick.\nOther Briscola WWW sites and software\nThe freeware and PRO versions of Gianfranco Marzano\'s Briscola computer program are available from his Home Page dei giochi di carte italiani.\nAt the Italian site Tretre you can play Briscola on line against live players or against the computer, and also find rules of Briscola and several variants.\nAt GiochiStars you can play two-player Briscola games and tournaments online against live opponents\n \nWith Orfeo Bernardo\'s Briscola Mano a Mano you can play against the computer or against a live opponent.\nan Kafol has developed a Flash web site providing online multiplayer brikola (briscola) for 2, 3 or 4 players.\nAt Davide Gullo\'s GDM community site you can play Briscola Chiamata on line.\nWith the two-player Briscola program at  Solitari con le Carte you can now play online against the computer using any web browser.\nYou can play Briscola and Briscola Chiamata on line at the Italian site biska.com.\nHere is Brian Friesen\'s freeware Briscola program for Windows.\nYou can download a freeware Briscola program from Thanos Card Games.\nWith the free Windows program BTM Pro, obtainable from Drazen\'s homepage, you can play Briscola and some other Italian games against the computer or against other players over a network.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Ace-Ten Games > Briscola\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1995, 2003, 2005, 2010, 2012.

The play continues until all cards have been played.\n\nThe holder should avoid revealing his identity until the time comes\nto play the called card. The other players should try to\ndeduce which player is playing with the caller, and adjust\ntheir strategy accordingly.\n\nScoring\n\nAt the end of the game, points gained by the caller and by the holder are counted together.\n\nIf the total is equal to or more than what the caller declared before the game, he gets 2 points, the holder takes 1 points, and the three other players get -1 (negative) point each. If the total is less than the declared amount, the three players get 1 points each, while the caller loses 2 points and the holder 1 point.\n\nAt the start of the game, the players should agree how many points  they will play to - usually 10-15 points. Further games are played  until someone wins by reaching this total.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThe caller can, if he has an exceptionally good hand, call for a card he has in its own hand. This will gain (or lose) him 4 points, while his opponents still gain/lose 1 point each.\n\nThe game is extremely funny: players need to decide whose side the others are on, mainly by observing the cards played during a round (it\'s forbidden to talk about the cards in one\'s own hand, as usual). The holder should walk a thin line between gaining points for himself and his partner, while avoiding being discovered too soon.\n\nVariation\n\nSome people play a different method of bidding. Players state the rank of the Briscola they wish to call (e.g. ace, three, king, ...), the objective being always to win at least 61 points. Each player in turn must pass or bid a lower rank than the previous bidder. So the bidding is won by whoever is prepared to call the lowest card. If someone bids "two", the bidding can continue by other players offering to call a two and win more than 61 points, and then the player who was prepared to call a two and win most points would win the bidding.\n\n\n\nBrikula in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nVeselko Kelava reports that in Bosnia and Herzegovina Brikula is  played with a 32-card pack, each suit ranking: A, 10, K, Q, J, 9, 8, 7. The card values are A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2. Any number  can  play without partnerships, or four can play as partners, two against two. When the talon comes  close to an end and some players draw and some don\'t get a chance. Only  those who drew play to the following trick, so that all again have the  same number of cards in hand.\nFour-card or double Brikula\nIn both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, a variation is played in which four cards (instead of three) are dealt to each player, and everyone plays twice to each trick: after everyone has played one card, the play continues around the table and all play a second card. Whoever plays the highest trump or if there are none, the highest card of the suit that was led takes all the cards of the double trick. Everyone in turn draws a card from the talon and then everyone draws a second card so that all have four cards again, and the winner of the previous trick leads to a new double trick.\nOther Briscola WWW sites and software\nThe freeware and PRO versions of Gianfranco Marzano\'s Briscola computer program are available from his Home Page dei giochi di carte italiani.\nAt the Italian site Tretre you can play Briscola on line against live players or against the computer, and also find rules of Briscola and several variants.\nAt GiochiStars you can play two-player Briscola games and tournaments online against live opponents\n \nWith Orfeo Bernardo\'s Briscola Mano a Mano you can play against the computer or against a live opponent.\nan Kafol has developed a Flash web site providing online multiplayer brikola (briscola) for 2, 3 or 4 players.\nAt Davide Gullo\'s GDM community site you can play Briscola Chiamata on line.\nWith the two-player Briscola program at  Solitari con le Carte you can now play online against the computer using any web browser.\nYou can play Briscola and Briscola Chiamata on line at the Italian site biska.com.\nHere is Brian Friesen\'s freeware Briscola program for Windows.\nYou can download a freeware Briscola program from Thanos Card Games.\nWith the free Windows program BTM Pro, obtainable from Drazen\'s homepage, you can play Briscola and some other Italian games against the computer or against other players over a network.\n\n\n\n\nHome Page > Classified Index > Trick Taking Games > Ace-Ten Games > Briscola\n    \n\n\nThis page is maintained by John McLeod (john@pagat.com).\n      \n       John McLeod, 1995, 2003, 2005, 2010, 2012.
